# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Docusaurus-based documentation website for Let's Book, a boat rental booking system. The site serves as both user documentation and API documentation for the platform.

## Development Commands

### Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

Starts development server with live reload. Note: Search functionality only works in build mode.

### Build

```bash
npm build
```

Generates static content into the `build` directory.

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run typecheck        # TypeScript type checking
npm run prettier-check   # Check code formatting
npm run prettier        # Format code with Prettier
```

### Other Commands

```bash
npm run serve           # Serve built site locally
npm run clear           # Clear Docusaurus cache
npm run deploy          # Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

## Project Architecture

### Core Structure

- **Docusaurus Configuration**: `docusaurus.config.ts` - Main configuration with site metadata, plugins, and theme
  settings
- **Content**: `docs/` directory contains all documentation organized by feature areas
- **API Documentation**: `api/` directory contains OpenAPI specs served via Redocusaurus
- **Release Notes**: `releases/` directory contains versioned release notes served as blog posts
- **Custom Components**: `src/components/` contains React components that are used throughout the docs

### Key Features

- **Guides**: Description of all features and how to use them. Maps to the `/guides` route
- **Courses**: More strategic documents on how to improve your company, available at `/courses`
- **API Docs**: Redocusaurus integration serves OpenAPI specs at `/api` route
- **Release Notes**: Configured as blog posts under `/releases` route
- **Help Integration**: HelpScout Beacon widget integrated for user support

### Content Organization

Documentation is auto-generated from folder structure via `sidebars.ts`.

### Styling

- Custom CSS in `src/css`. 
  - Content related things (default styling of text and images) goes into `content.css`
  - Footer styling: `footer.css`
  - Menu tweaks (main navigation): `menu.css`
  - Everything else in `custom.css`
- IBM Plex Sans and Rubik fonts from Google Fonts
- Only light theme support with custom primary color (#081590)

## Development Notes

### Deployment

- Automatic deployment on push to `main` branch
- Deployed to GitHub Pages at `letsbook.github.io`
- Environment variables: `HELPSCOUT_BEACON_ID` for help widget

### Content Editing

- Documentation files are Markdown in `docs/` folder
- Release notes are Markdown in `releases/` folder with date-based naming
- Images are stored close to the content they're used in
- Edit URLs configured for GitHub integration (disabled in production)

### Code inside markdown

- Markdown files that contain code must be renamed to `.mdx`
- ALWAYS extract HTML to a React component at `src/components`
- All imports should use ES6 syntax (`import`) and not the old skool `require()` function
- Imports should use the `@site/` prefix
- Imports must use single quotes
- Use the `Button` component over custom `a.button` elements

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone of Voice
- **To the point, witty, short** - no long-winded explanations
- **NEVER use em dashes** (no â€”)
- **Customer-facing** for boat rental operators and boat clubs
- Focus on **HOW things work**, not WHY they work
- **Get straight to the action** - no fluff phrases like "First things first"

### Content Structure
- **Sentence case for headers** (only first letter capital, except proper nouns)
- **Direct dashboard links at top** of each section
- **Minimal explanatory text** - let users get to work quickly
- **Concrete examples** where helpful, but keep them brief
- **Step-by-step workflow** focus

### Style Guidelines
- No unnecessary introductory phrases
- No long bullet point descriptions
- Maximum efficiency in word choice
- Use dashboard links: `https://dashboard.letsbook.app/...`
- Target audience: boat rental companies who want practical solutions

### API Documentation

- OpenAPI specs split across multiple YAML files in `openapi/` directory
- Components organized in `schemas/`, `parameters/`, and `responses/` subdirectories
- Main spec file: `openapi/index.openapi.yaml`
