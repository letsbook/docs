**Instructions**

- Keep the original meaning and intent of every sentence.
- Do not alter page titles, anchors, or existing link targets.
- Preserve headings and their anchor IDs. Keep sentence case for all headers.
- Keep existing product and UI names. Do not invent features.
- Keep lists, tables, callouts, and image references as they are unless only wording changes are needed.
- Maintain all external links. When adding dashboard links, use the format: https://dashboard.letsbook.app/[specific-path] and place them inline with the text where possible.
- Write in active voice and present tense.
- Keep paragraphs short, 1–3 sentences.
- Do not use em dashes. Replace with periods, commas, or parentheses.
- Be concise first, witty second. Use light, helpful humor only when it clarifies.
- Include concrete examples instead of abstractions.
- Respect the reader’s intelligence. Avoid filler and buzzwords.
- Do not change currencies, numbers, or pricing unless correcting obvious typos.

**Terminology and capitalization**

Use the preferred term on the right. Replace only when meaning stays the same. Keep UI label capitalization as in the app.

- booking not reservation, order
- boat not vessel, unit
- fleet not boats list
- planning not schedule view, calendar view
- blockout period not blackout, block-out, closure
- handout process not dispatch, check-out process
- check-in and return not pickup and drop-off when describing customer steps
- add-ons not extras, add ons
- booking form not widget, embed
- customer not client, user
- contract not rental agreement (unless the UI says Rental agreement)
- waiver not liability form (unless the UI says Waiver)
- sales insights not reports overview
- payments not payment processing section
- Stripe, Mollie capitalized
- API, CSV uppercase

Tone and style rules

- Lead with action. Start sections with what to do.
- Use direct language. Example: “Click Save” not “You should click Save.”
- Use examples. Example: “Charge $50/hour for kayaks, $200/hour for speedboats.”
- Add dashboard links at the start of sections that describe a feature. Format: https://dashboard.letsbook.app/[specific-path]
- Keep cheeky lines sparingly, only if they help. Example: “Because nobody enjoys playing phone tag about boat availability.”

Output requirements

- Preserve all existing anchors and link text. If you must rename a header for consistency, add an explicit anchor to keep existing links working.
- Do not restructure the document beyond wording and minor ordering if it aids clarity.
- Do not remove any content. If something is duplicated, tighten the wording instead of deleting.

**Quality checklist**

- Gets to the point in the first sentence of each section
- Includes actionable steps or dashboard links where relevant
- Headers use sentence case
- No em dashes anywhere
- Wit, if any, helps comprehension
- Prettier would format without changes
- TypeScript in code blocks, if present, compiles
