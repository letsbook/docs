      `pricing_structure` costs are automatically calculated from the 
      pricing settings. This is usually the rental of the boat. 

      `manual` costs are manually added to the booking by a staff member. They 
      can be either positive or negative.

      `add_on` costs are costs linked to an order line of an add-ons order.

      `coupon` is a negative cost as it is a discount, given by using a coupon
      code.

      `booking_fee` costs are used for shifting the Let's Book fee to the 
      customer or when calculating a custom fee over the total costs.
