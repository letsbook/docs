      If set to true, the booking will be marked as paid by adding
      a cash payment equal to the unpaid costs. It will be ignored when the
      booking is already fully paid.

      Note that slot based pricing may fail to calculate the correct amount
      as the slot is not known when the booking is created using the API.
