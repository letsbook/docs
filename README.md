# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without
having to restart the server. However, search only works in `build` mode.

## Build

```bash
npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting
service.

## Deployment

Just push to `main`
