# Customer notes, schedule duplication & SMS automation

We've added some handy tools to make your daily operations smoother.

## Notes per customer

Keep useful customer info right where it belongsâ€”no more sticky notes. Add remarks directly to each customer profile.

Track things like dietary restrictions, previous issues, VIP preferences, or equipment requests. Notes appear in booking details and during check-in, so your team always has the context they need.

## Duplicate rental schedules

Working with complex schedules? You can now duplicate and tweak them in no time.

Perfect for seasonal operations - duplicate your summer schedule for next year, then adjust pricing or availability as needed. Set up complex schedules in minutes instead of starting from scratch.

## Rich text in descriptions

Boat and dock category descriptions now support rich text. Add links, lists, or extra details to inform your customers.

Add clickable links to equipment manuals, create bulleted lists of included features, or format text with bold/italic emphasis. Enhanced descriptions appear throughout the booking flow.

## SMS after a trip ends

You can now send an automatic text message when a trip ends, to remind customers to return their boat.

Reduce confusion and no-shows with automatic return reminders. Customize your message and timing in notification settings.

## Other improvements

- Improved security and performance
- Application fees are now calculated over whole amount when using downpayments
- Place all boats of a boat model at a dock at once
