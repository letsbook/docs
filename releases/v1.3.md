# v1.3 - Add custom questions to your booking flow

You can now personalize the booking process by adding custom questions. Gather all the details you need, such as:

- **Experience level** 
- **Special requests or preferences**
- **The occasion for the trip**
- **Where customers would like to be picked up**

Answers are saved with each booking for seamless preparation. Start customizing your flow today via your dashboard!

## Other smaller updates

- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired bookings older than one week are now automatically removed to keep your system tidy.
- **Custom Slot Names**: You can now configure the names of your slots in payment overviews for clearer reporting.
- **New for Boat Clubs**: Set monthly and daily limits on future booking hours for specific customer types to better manage availability.
