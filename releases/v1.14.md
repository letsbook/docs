# Manage your schedule your way with blockouts

![Photo of a girl hanging a closed sign](./images/v0.14.blockout_periods.webp)

Take boats out of service for a few hours, days, or even months. Use blockout dates to instantly control availability for maintenance, private events, or planned downtime. Pick exactly which boats to block. If you use docks, you can block those too.

Blocked periods appear in your Blockout dates overview, and they also pin to the availability bars in your planning overview so you never miss them.
