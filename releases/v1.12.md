# v1.12 - More control over your add-ons

![Interface to export Add-ons from you boat rental platform](./images/v1.12.add-extra-boat-rental-software.png)

We've added a brand-new add-on order overview, built around your team.

- For the planner: a complete view of all upcoming add-ons, per day and in total.
- For fulfillment: a clear timeline of what needs to go out and when.
- For reporting: easy validation and reconciliation with suppliers.

Filter by time range (such as 'tomorrow' or 'next week') and category, and instantly see what's scheduled.

Manage your extras via [Add-ons](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/add-ons).

## Other smaller updates

- Answers to custom booking questions now show up automatically in the confirmation email you receive.
- You can now decide if Let's Book should suggest other boats or dates when something's fully booked. Not a fit for your business? Turn it off.
- You can now copy new coupon codes to your clipboard right awayâ€”makes things easier!
