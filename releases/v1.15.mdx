# Finance got a makeover: discounts and cost clarity

![Finance overview for boat rental](./images/1.15.finance_overview_boatrental.webp)

The finance section just got way clearer. Your balance is shown upfront, every cost on a booking is broken down. Standard costs are now locked, so you always see the original pricing. Much cleaner picture of what actually happened.

Need to adjust something? Add a discount. Just create negative manual costs to balance out other charges. Keeps the original costs intact while giving you full control.

## Charge cards twice (or more)

Popular request from our US friends: save credit card info and charge customers later without bugging them again. Damage deposit? Extra hours? Just charge the card on file.

Flip the switch in your Stripe settings: "Request permission for offline charges".

## Support got a glow-up

Our help docs were getting dusty. So we rebuilt the whole thing from scratch.

New search that actually finds what you need. Clear sections for day-to-day work, revenue tips, and settings deep-dives. Video walkthroughs where text won't cut it. And a homepage that gets you where you need to be in one click.

Oh, and the search has AI built in. Ask a question in your own words, get an answer tailored to your situation—pulling insights from across all our docs. Saves you the browsing time.
