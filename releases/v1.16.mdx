# Webhooks: Connect Let's Book to all your other software

![Webhooks integration](./images/v1.16.webhooks_boatrental_software.png)

Get instant notifications when things happen in Let's Book. New booking confirmed? Customer ordered add-ons? Someone signed up? Send that data anywhere you want—your CRM, accounting software, Slack, or custom tools.

Set a URL, pick your events, and you're done. Real-time updates, automatically. Perfect for building AI-powered workflows that respond to your business in real-time.

## What you can do

- **Sync everything** - Send booking data to Airtable, Google Sheets, or your dashboard
- **Automate accounting** - Create invoices in QuickBooks or Xero when bookings are confirmed
- **Track add-on orders** - Get notified when customers order specific products (life jackets, fuel, skipper service)
- **Keep teams updated** - Push notifications to Slack when bookings come in or customers add extras
- **Build AI workflows** - Chain actions with [Zapier](https://zapier.com), [Make](https://make.com), or [n8n](https://n8n.io) to trigger AI agents and automations
- **Connect your own tools** - Works with anything that receives HTTPS requests
