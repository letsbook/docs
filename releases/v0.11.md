# Enhanced boat management

Customers can start, pause, and end their trips remotely, all within their booking window.

## Trip Control Features

**Before Departure**: The customer receives an SMS with a link to their booking detail page. On this page, they can browse available boats for their selected time slot and make their choice.

**Starting the Boat**: If in line with rental settings, they can effortlessly start the boat with a simple click.

**After the Trip**: Upon returning from their trip, the customer can easily switch off the boat, signaling the end of their trip. As the rental owner, you have access to the entire trip timeline on the booking detail page, providing valuable insights into the journey.

We think it's a nice way to offer convenience and freedom while maintaining control over your rentals. Read more about [connected fleet](/guides/settings/boats/connect-boats) and some tips for implementing it  perfectly.
