# v1.4 - Pass the booking fee to your customers

We're introducing a new feature that gives you more flexibility in handling booking fees. Instead of absorbing the platform fee yourself, you can now pass it on directly to your customers.

## Key Benefits

- **Better Margin Control** – Ensure your profits are unaffected by platform fees.
- **Flexible Pricing** – Decide whether to absorb the fee or pass it on.
- **Seamless Integration** – The fee is automatically added to the final customer price at checkout.

With this update, you have full control over how booking fees are handled, making your rental business even more efficient.

## Other smaller updates

- Added an option to show costs at the payment step.
- Set a maximum number of bookable boats per boat model.
- Default selection of the guest customer type when creating a new customer.
- Enabled showing amounts excluding tax until the payment step.
