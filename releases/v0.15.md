At Let's Book, we've made it possible for you to link a boat to a booking and track the booking's progress with color-coded indicators: green for smooth sailing, yellow for setting sail soon, and red for "oops, they're running late!"

By doing this you get a comprehensive overview of which boats are docked or out making waves.

## Allow customers to cancel their own bookings

Here it is: the option for customers to cancel their trip themselves. But of course, not just anyone can do it: as the rental owner, you determine which customer types are allowed to cancel (for example, only your members), and under what conditions.

Go to [customer types](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/customer-types), select the role you want to edit, and find the section called 'cancellation settings'. You can also add a specific message before cancellation.
