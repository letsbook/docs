# Smart Alternatives

**Smarter bookings, fewer drop-offs**

We've added a powerful feature to keep customers booking when their first choice isn't available: Smart Alternatives. When a boat is unavailable, we automatically suggest similar boats from the same category.

## How it works

Smart Alternatives uses boat categories to suggest relevant alternatives. If someone wants a "Speedboat 8p" but it's booked, they'll see other boats in the "Speedboat" category that are available.

**The flow:**

1. Customer picks a boat that's unavailable
2. System checks the boat's category
3. Shows available alternatives from the same category
4. If no boats available that day, suggests alternative dates/times

## Setting up categories

To use Smart Alternatives effectively:

- Go to your [boats](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/models), select a boat model, and click Edit
- Use the Category dropdown to assign boats to logical groups ("Small boats", "Speedboats", "Luxury", etc.)
- Create categories that make sense for your fleet and customer choices

## Control options

You have full control over when alternatives appear:

- Turn off suggestions per category if certain boats shouldn't be alternatives
- Disable the feature entirely via the [alternatives page](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/booking-form/alternatives)
- Configure which alternative dates/times to show when nothing is available

This keeps more customers in your booking flow instead of leaving to find alternatives elsewhere.

## Other updates

- Improved alternative date suggestions when there's no availability
- Fixed several bugs throughout the platform
- You can now change your booking page URL independently from your business name
