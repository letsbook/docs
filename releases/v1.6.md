# v1.6 - Smart Alternatives

**Smarter bookings, fewer drop-offs**

We've added a powerful new feature to avoid 'dead ends' in the booking flow: Smart Alternatives. If a boat is unavailable, we suggests a similar one from the same category — keeping customers on board and your calendar nicely filled.

## To get started:

- Go to your [boats](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/boats), select a boat, and click Edit.
- You'll now see a Category dropdown. Use it to assign the boat to an existing category—or create a new one that fits your fleet.
- Want full control? You can turn off automatic suggestions per category or on the alternatives page.

If no boats are available that day, we'll suggest alternative time slots or dates — so your customers stay in the flow.

Smart, right?

## Other smaller updates

- Improved the alternative dates shown when there's no availability on a specific day.
- Fixed several bugs and made a few small, yet stylish improvements throughout.
- You can now change your booking page URL without touching your business name. You're welcome!
