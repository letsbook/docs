- Edit emails in the languages you've set up for your rental business.
- Add variables yourselfâ€”it's not just text anymore! Make your emails more dynamic by including images, buttons, and even full content blocks.

All default notifications have been updated and translated, giving you the perfect starting point to tailor them to your needs.
