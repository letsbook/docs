# v1.9 - Custom booking labels


Labels are here! You can now add your own labels to bookings — like "Cleaned", "Engagement trip", or "Birthday Surprise" — to keep things clear and organized. It's a fun and flexible way to filter and find what matters most in your booking overview.

## Other small updates

• You can now click back and forth to a booking detail page without losing your filters — we'll remember them for you!
• Also: we squashed a bunch of bugs. 🐞
