# v1.11 - More relaxed booking edits

## Key Features

### Enhanced Booking Editing
- Full editing freedom when the boat is claimed but the trip hasn't started yet
- You can now switch to a different boat model — as long as the trip hasn't started
- Editing ongoing trips is now smoother — even when pickup's in the past
- Past pickup times are visible again in the UI (no more disappearing time fields)
- It's now visually clearer which boat is linked to a trip, so you instantly see that it's unavailable for others
- Fixed an issue where availability could show up incorrectly when editing a booking

### Custom Phone Number Settings
- Admins now get full flexibility: make the phone number field required, optional, or remove it entirely
- Shape your booking flow the way you want it
- Easy-to-use settings interface for phone number configuration

## Other Updates
- Schedules still linked to your rental setup can no longer be accidentally removed
- Stripe integration: smoother than ever
- Various bug fixes and performance improvements
