## Key Features

- Full editing freedom when the boat is claimed but the trip hasn't started yetYou can now switch to a different boat model — as long as the trip hasn't startedEditing ongoing trips is now smoother — even when pickup's in the pastPast pickup times are visible again in the UI (no more disappearing time fields)It's now visually clearer which boat is linked to a trip.  So you instantly see that it's unavailable for othersWe also fixed an issue where availability could show up incorrectly when editing a booking.




  Custom phone number settings




  Admins now get full flexibility: make the phone number field required, optional, or remove it entirely. Shape your booking flow the way you want it.
