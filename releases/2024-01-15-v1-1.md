# v1.1 - Our new contract & waiver integration

## Key Features

- Smart: Let the system automatically decide between the single or multi-day interface.Primarily single day: Select this if most of your rentals are for the same day.Primarily multi day: Choose this if you focus on multi-day rentals.This way, customers are always nudged in the right direction while booking. Another small improvement: if you have many slots, we'll automatically ask for your preferred duration first. Then, we'll show the filtered options.
