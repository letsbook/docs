# Finance got a makeover: discounts and cost clarity

<!-- TODO: Add hero image v1.15.finance.webp -->

The finance section just got way clearer. Your balance shows upfront, every cost on a booking is broken down, and you can see exactly which ones you can edit. Much easier to work with.

Oh, and you can now create discount rules. Just add negative manual costs to balance out other charges. Works like a charm.

## Charge cards twice (or more)

Popular request from our US friends: save credit card info and charge customers later without bugging them again. Damage deposit? Extra hours? Just charge the card on file.

Flip the switch in your Stripe settings: "Request permission for offline charges".

## Other smaller updates

- Buttons everywhere got a fresh coat of paint. Click away.
- Booking timeline shows more useful info about what changed and when.
- Cost structure tweaked so discounts don't mess things up.
