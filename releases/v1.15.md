# Finance got a makeover: discounts and cost clarity

<!-- TODO: Add hero image v1.15.finance.webp -->

The finance section just got way clearer. Your balance shows upfront, every cost on a booking is broken down, and you can see exactly which ones you can edit. Much easier to work with.

Oh, and you can now create discount rules. Just add negative manual costs to balance out other charges. Works like a charm.

## Charge cards twice (or more)

Popular request from our US friends: save credit card info and charge customers later without bugging them again. Damage deposit? Extra hours? Just charge the card on file.

Flip the switch in your Stripe settings: "Request permission for offline charges".

## Support got a glow-up

Our help docs were getting dusty. So we rebuilt the whole thing from scratch.

New search that actually finds what you need. Clear sections for day-to-day work, revenue tips, and settings deep-dives. Video walkthroughs where text won't cut it. And a homepage that gets you where you need to be in one click.

Oh, and the search has AI built in. Ask a question in your own words, get an answer tailored to your situation—pulling insights from across all our docs. Saves you the browsing time.
