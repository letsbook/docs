# v1.12 - More control over your add-ons

We've added a brand-new add-on order overview, built around your team.

- For the planner: a complete view of all upcoming add-ons, per day and in total.
- For fulfillment: a clear timeline of what needs to go out and when.
- For reporting: easy validation and reconciliation with suppliers.

Filter by time range (such as 'tomorrow' or 'next week') and category, and instantly see what's scheduled.
