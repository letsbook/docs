# v1.8 - Sync your bookings to your personal calendar

Stay on top of your schedule wherever you are. You can now connect Let's Book to your Google Calendar, Apple Calendar or Outlook so all your upcoming bookings automatically appear in your personal calendar.

## How it works

We generate a unique calendar feed link for your account that syncs your booking schedule with your external calendar app. It's view-only, so you can see your bookings but any changes need to be made in Let's Book.

**What gets synced:**

- Bookings from the past 7 days
- Bookings for the next 30 days
- Updates automatically based on your calendar app settings

**Update timing:**

- **Google Calendar:** Updates every 12 hours
- **Apple Calendar:** You control refresh rate (minimum 5 minutes)
- **Outlook:** Based on your local settings

## Setting it up

Go to your profile page, find "Stay in sync" and click "My calendars". Toggle enabled, copy the link, and add it to your calendar app of choice.
