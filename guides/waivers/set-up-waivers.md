# Set up waivers and contracts

You can ask your customers to sign all kinds of documents. This could be waivers, rental agreements or other types of contracts. With our [WaiverForever](https://www.waiverforever.com/?referral=letsbook) integration, all of this is possible. 

## Getting started

1. First, create an account at [WaiverForever](https://www.waiverforever.com/?referral=letsbook).
1. Head over to [Waiver Templates](https://app.waiverforever.com/templates) and create a new template.
1. Pick one of their default templates from the gallery, upload an existing PDF or create one from scratch.
1. Tweak the template to your liking. Once your template is ready, publish it!
1. With your template published, head over to [Webhooks & API](https://app.waiverforever.com/settings/api) and generate a "New Application Key".
1. Copy the newly created key, paste it under WaiverForever API Key on our [Integrations](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/integrations) page and submit the form.

## Linking a document to a dock and boat model

Great job on getting the integration set up. Now we'll configure when the document is displayed to your customers. 

1. Navigate to the [Rental Setup](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/rental-setup) page and pick the relevant dock / boat model combination.
1. Now you should be able to link specific documents to this combination.

Step 5: Inform Customers in Booking Confirmation
To ensure customers know they need to sign a waiver, edit your booking confirmation message.

Go to the Notifications page.
Add a note in the booking confirmation email explaining that waivers must be signed and can be accessed on the booking detail page.
By completing this step, waivers will be fully integrated into your Let's Book system, ensuring all necessary legal documents are properly managed.
