# Let's Book Dashboard Guide

## Getting Started

Welcome to Let's Book! Your dashboard is where you'll spend most of your time managing your rental business. Think of it
as mission control for your bookings, inventory, and customers.

## Finding Your Way Around

### The Sidebar Menu

On the left side of your screen, you'll find your main navigation menu. You can collapse it if you need more space by
clicking the menu icon. Here's what each section does:

**Dashboard** - This is your home base. It shows you what's happening right now and gives you quick access to the most
important tasks.

**Bookings** - Everything related to your reservations lives here. Create new bookings, check existing ones, or update
booking details.

**Inventory** - Keep track of all your rental equipment and gear. See what's available, what's out on rental, and what
needs maintenance.

**Rental Method** - Set up how your rentals work - pricing, policies, and booking rules.

**Settings** - Customize how Let's Book works for your business.

You'll also find these handy shortcuts:

**Booking Form** - Jump straight to your customer-facing booking page (great for walk-in customers!)

**Bridge** - Connect Let's Book with other tools you use in your business.

**Account** - Your personal profile and account settings.

### The Top Bar

At the top of your dashboard, you'll see:

- A search box to find anything quickly
- Release notes (to see what's new in Let's Book)
- Your profile menu for account settings and logging out

## Your Dashboard Home

When you first log in, you'll see your dashboard overview. This is designed to give you the most important information
at a glance.

### Quick Actions

Right at the top, you'll see five big buttons for the things you do most often:

1. **Add Booking** - Start a new reservation right away
2. **Planning** - See your schedule and what's coming up
3. **Fleet** - Check on your inventory and equipment
4. **Bookings** - View all your current and past bookings
5. **Sales Insights** - Look at how your business is performing

### What's Coming Up

The "Upcoming Pickups" section shows you who's picking up equipment soon. You'll see:

- Customer names
- When they're supposed to pick up (like "in 3 days")
- Where they're picking up from
- Quick links to see the full booking details

This helps you stay on top of your schedule and make sure everything's ready for your customers.

### Recent Activity

Below that, you'll see your recent bookings. This gives you a quick view of what's been happening lately - who's booked,
when they booked, and you can click on any booking to see the details.

## What You Can Do

### Managing Bookings

Creating and managing bookings is probably what you'll do most. You can:

- Make new bookings for customers (online, over the phone, or in person)
- Edit existing bookings if customers need changes
- See the status of each booking (confirmed, completed, cancelled, etc.)
- Search for specific bookings using customer names, dates, or booking numbers
- Filter your bookings to find exactly what you're looking for

### Planning and Scheduling

The planning section gives you a visual view of what's happening when. You can:

- See which equipment is booked and when
- Check availability for new bookings
- Make sure you have enough gear for busy periods
- Schedule pickups and returns

### Customer Information

Let's Book keeps track of your customers for you:

- Each customer gets their own profile with their booking history
- You can quickly look up past customers for repeat bookings
- See what customers have rented before
- Keep notes about customer preferences or special requirements

### Business Insights

Want to know how your business is doing? The sales insights section shows you:

- How much revenue you're making
- Which items are your best renters
- Busy periods and quiet times
- Trends over time to help you make business decisions

## Connecting to Other Tools

If you use other software for your business (like accounting software, email marketing, or inventory management), Let's
Book can probably connect to it through the Bridge feature. This saves you from entering the same information multiple
times.

## Getting Help

If you ever get stuck, look for:

- The help system built into Let's Book (usually a question mark icon)
- Release notes to see if new features have been added
- Your account manager if you have one

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your Dashboard

**Keep it fresh** - Your dashboard updates automatically, so you're always seeing the latest information.

**Use the search** - Instead of clicking through menus, try typing what you're looking for in the search box.

**Customize your view** - Many screens let you filter and sort information the way that makes sense for your business.

**Check your upcoming pickups regularly** - This helps you stay prepared and provide great customer service.

**Use quick actions** - Those big buttons on your dashboard are there to help you do common tasks faster.

## Mobile and Tablet Use

Your dashboard works on phones and tablets too, so you can check on things when you're not at your computer. The layout
automatically adjusts to fit smaller screens while keeping all the important information accessible.

The Let's Book dashboard is designed to grow with your business. Whether you're just starting out or managing a large
operation, it gives you the tools to stay organized and provide great service to your customers.
