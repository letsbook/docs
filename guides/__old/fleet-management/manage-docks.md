# Manage Docks

## Add dock

Go to your docks overview and hit add. Now enter:

1. **Dock name, descriptions, details**: The description will be shown on the booking form. Make sure to mark the correct location with the location marker.

2. **Contact details**: These will be displayed on the booking form and booking confirmation email.

3. **Photos**: Add horizontal photos in jpg or png format. You may want to crop the photos in advance using a photo editing tool or online service.

4. **Departures**: Set the maximum number of departures at the same time, if desired. This can help manage workload on the dock.

### Docked boats

On the dock detail page, you can view which boats are currently docked at the location. Enter a date to see which boats are rented out at that time. To edit the boat placements, go to the boat section and select specific boats.
