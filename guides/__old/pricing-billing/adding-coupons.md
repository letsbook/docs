 You can set special conditions for your coupon. Specify:
: - **For which boats it is valid**- to offer a discount on a specific type of boat. - **For which docks it is valid**- to make the code only valid at certain locations. - **Between what dates it is valid** - for temporary promotions. - **Between what times it is valid**- to limit the code to certain times of day. - **On which days of the week it is valid**- to specify which days the code is valid. - **What duration the trip should have** - to make the code only valid for trips of a certain duration. - **What are the exception dates** - on which days the code is not valid

After setting the conditions, you can add codes that allow customers to apply the discount.

## Adding codes

There are 3 ways you can add codes:

A
: **Generate codes** This is the best option if you want to create many different codes. You can choose how many times each code can be used and specify the code format.

B
: **Enter manually** You can enter a code and set the number of times it can be used. This is useful for creating a single code for a large group of people.

C
: **Import codes**

    You can also import codes from Excel or by copying and pasting them into a text field. This is helpful for adding a large number of codes and having complete control over the code format.

## Export codes

- To export codes, go to the coupons section and find the coupons whose codes you want to export.
- On the detail page, you will find a button to export the codes to Excel.

These exports can be helpful for finding a specific code or for sending to a copy shop to print physical coupons with unique codes.
