# Connect boats

Create a hardware connection between your boats and Let's Book software, allowing customers to start boats themselves with their smartphone and giving you complete remote control over your fleet.

## What is connected fleet?

Connected fleet creates a seamless link between your bookings and physical boats. Customers receive an SMS with their booking details, select their boat, and start the engine directly from their phone. Meanwhile, you get real-time monitoring, GPS tracking, and remote control capabilities.

**Customer experience:**

- SMS notification with booking link before departure
- Select available boat from their booking page
- Start and stop the boat engine with one click
- Automatic trip timeline registration

**Your benefits:**

- Perfect overview of fleet status and trip progress
- Remote boat control for quick assistance
- Accurate rental duration tracking
- Less staff required for check-in/check-out
- Real-time location monitoring and battery voltage tracking
