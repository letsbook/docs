# Streamlining partner bookings: a step-by-step guide

Generate unique URLs for your partners, allowing them to embed the booking form directly onto their website. This makes it easy to track bookings coming from their website. Here's how to implement partner booking integration with Let's Book:

## Generate a unique URL for your partner

- Log in to your Let's Book account and navigate to the [booking form settings](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/booking-form/integration-instructions)
- Toggle "Integrate on partner website" in step 2.
- Enter a "Unique partner identifier" (e.g., partner's name) and copy the generated link.

## Share the URL and embed instructions

- Share the unique URL with your partner and provide [embedding instructions](../booking-form/add-to-website.mdx). 

## Track partner bookings

Easily track [bookings](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/bookings) using the unique partner identifier assigned to each URL.

- Filter bookings by specific partners in the booking overview by clicking the filter icon and selecting the partner from the dropdown.
- Export these bookings to Excel for further analysis.
- You can also view partner details for each booking on booking detail level.

## Optional: set specific pricing

You can also use the partner code to set specific pricing. Go to [pricing](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/pricing) and choose a setup from 'slot pricing' or 'flexible pricing'. When setting a price, under "conditions", select "booked via partner" and then proceed with the desired settings.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage partner bookings and foster collaboration with your affiliates. For additional assistance or inquiries, reach out to our dedicated support team at support@lets-book.com.
