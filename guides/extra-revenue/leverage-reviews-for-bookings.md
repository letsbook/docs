# Automate reviews and loyalty

> **‚ö†Ô∏è FIRST DRAFT** - Lola check deze nog even goed.

üëâ **[Manage notifications](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/notifications)** | **[Setup guide](/guides/settings/rental-setups/edit-customer-notifications)**

Send the right message at the right time. Automated emails drive reviews, repeat bookings, and upsells without manual work.

## Why email timing matters

Customers are most receptive at specific moments. Right after their trip for reviews. 6 hours before for practical info. 50 weeks later for rebooking. Automate these touchpoints once, benefit forever.

## Available notification triggers

**Email after the trip** - Strike while memory is fresh
**Email 6h before pickup** - Last-minute practical info
**Email after 50 weeks of inactivity** - Win back past customers
**Email when confirmed** - Upsell opportunity
**Email when canceled** - Keep the relationship alive

## After trip: Reviews and thank you

Best time to ask for reviews. Memory is fresh, emotions are positive, damage deposits returned.

**Use cases:**
- Request Google/TripAdvisor/Facebook review
- Offer discount code for next booking as thank you
- Ask permission to use their photos in marketing
- Collect feedback on experience

**Example message:**
"Loved your trip? Leave us a review on Google and get 10% off your next adventure: THANKS-JOHN-2024"

Create discount codes in [coupon setup](/guides/extra-revenue/discount-codes-and-coupon-setup).

## 6 hours before: Last-minute details

Customers check email before heading out. Perfect timing for practical info and last-minute upsells.

**Use cases:**
- Parking instructions and alternative routes
- Weather update: "Sunny day - bring sunscreen!"
- Last-minute add-on offer: "Add sunset snack package, just ‚Ç¨15"
- Merchandise preview: "Check out our new caps at the dock"
- What to bring reminder: water, towels, ID

**Example message:**
"Your boat is ready tomorrow! Park at lot B (see map). Don't forget sunscreen - it's going to be sunny. PS: We have cold drinks at the dock."

## 50 weeks later: Win them back

They haven't booked in almost a year. Automated reminder with incentive brings them back.

**Use cases:**
- Seasonal angle: "Remember last summer? Book your 2025 trip now"
- Exclusive offer: "We miss you! Here's 15% off as a welcome back gift"
- New features: "We added sunset tours since your last visit"
- Referral ask: "Know someone who'd love a boat trip?"

**Example message:**
"Almost a year since your last trip! Ready to get back on the water? Book this month and save 15%: COMEBACK2025"

## When confirmed: Upsells and prep

Booking confirmed. Customer is excited and engaged. Great moment for add-ons and cross-sells.

**Use cases:**
- Upsell add-ons: "90% of customers add the drinks package"
- Upgrade offer: "Premium boat available for just ‚Ç¨20 more"
- Set expectations: "Here's what to expect on your trip"
- Social proof: "Join 5,000+ happy customers this season"

**Example message:**
"Booking confirmed! Most customers add our drinks package (beer, wine, soft drinks) for ‚Ç¨25. Add now - can't be added later."

## When canceled: Keep the relationship

Booking canceled. Don't lose the customer forever.

**Use cases:**
- Sorry it didn't work out: "Book again anytime with 10% off: RAINCHECK10"
- Collect feedback: "What made you cancel? Help us improve"
- Alternative offer: "Can't make this date? We have availability next weekend"
- Stay in touch: "We'll send you seasonal deals"

**Example message:**
"Sorry your plans changed! Your 10% discount is waiting when you're ready to reschedule: RAINCHECK10"

## Getting review links

**Google Business:**
1. Open your Google Business profile
2. Go to "Ask for reviews"
3. Copy short URL
4. Add as button in email

**TripAdvisor:** Get review link from business dashboard.

**Facebook:** Link to your page reviews section.

## Discount code strategy

Personal codes work best: `THANKS-JOHN-2024`
- Customer feels special
- You track who shared the code
- See which reviewers drive referrals

**Settings:**
- Discount: 10-15% off
- Usage limit: 5-10 uses (viral sharing)
- Expiry: 6-12 months

Create in [discount codes](/guides/extra-revenue/discount-codes-and-coupon-setup).

## Legal boundaries

**Allowed:**
- Discount for ANY review (positive or negative)
- Thank you after review posted
- Win-back offers

**Not allowed:**
- Payment for positive reviews only
- Discount conditional on star rating
- Fake reviews

Focus on quantity, not manipulation. Check local regulations.
