# Leverage reviews for bookings

> **‚ö†Ô∏è FIRST DRAFT** - This article needs review and refinement.

üëâ **[Customize booking confirmation](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/settings/rental-setups/booking-confirmation)**

Turn happy customers into marketing machines. Automatically request reviews after trips, then use those reviews to drive new bookings with targeted discount codes.

## Why reviews matter

Boat rental is trust-based. Customers put safety and money in your hands. Reviews prove you deliver. More reviews = higher conversion rate = more bookings at same ad spend.

## The review loop

1. Customer completes trip
2. Automatic email requests review
3. They post review on Google/TripAdvisor/Facebook
4. You send thank-you with discount code for next booking
5. They share code with friends
6. New bookings arrive

## Setting up review requests

### Timing matters

Send review request 2-3 days after trip. Fresh memory, emotions settled, damage deposits returned.

### Email automation

Customize your post-booking emails in [customer notifications](/guides/settings/rental-setups/edit-customer-notifications).

Add review request block with direct links to your review platforms.

**Keep it short:**
"Enjoyed your trip? Share your experience - takes 60 seconds."

Include one-click links to:
- Google Business
- TripAdvisor
- Facebook
- Trustpilot (if applicable)

## Platforms that work

### Google Business (highest priority)
Shows in Google Maps and search results. Customers search "boat rental [location]" - your stars appear first.

Get Google Business link:
1. Open your Google Business profile
2. Copy "Ask for reviews" short URL
3. Add to email template

### TripAdvisor (tourism focus)
Tourist customers check TripAdvisor. Critical for vacation destinations.

### Facebook (local customers)
Your local Facebook page builds community. Reviews appear to friends of reviewers.

### Industry platforms
Depending on location:
- GetYourGuide
- Viator  
- Local tourism sites

## The discount code strategy

Reward reviewers with discount for next booking. Two benefits: thank loyal customers AND create referral codes they share.

### Automatic flow

Use [custom return URL](/guides/dive-deeper/custom-return-url) on review platforms to redirect reviewers to thank-you page with personalized discount code.

Or simpler: automated email after detecting new review (manual check).

### Code structure

**Personal codes** work best: `THANKS-JOHN-2024`
- Customer feels special
- You know who shared the code
- Track which reviewers drive bookings

Create in [discount codes setup](/guides/extra-revenue/discount-codes-and-coupon-setup).

### Sweet spot discounts

10-15% off next booking for reviewer. Generous enough to feel appreciated, not so much it kills margins.

**Usage limit:** 5-10 uses per code. They share with friends, you track viral effect.

**Expiry:** 6-12 months. Long enough for realistic rebooking, short enough to create urgency.

## Incentivizing reviews (legal boundaries)

**Allowed:**
- "Share your experience and get 10% off next trip"
- Discount for ANY review (positive or negative)
- Thank you gesture after review posted

**Not allowed (in most jurisdictions):**
- Payment for positive reviews only
- Discount conditional on 5-star rating
- Fake reviews (obviously)

Check local regulations. Focus on quantity (more reviews) not manipulation (only good ones).

## Making reviews visible

### On your website
Embed review widgets showing latest reviews. Builds trust on your own site.

### In booking form
Show star rating and review count in booking flow. [Style your booking form](/guides/settings/booking-form/match-branding) to include social proof.

### In email campaigns
Highlight great reviews in newsletters and promotional emails. "See why customers rate us 4.9/5 stars."

## Handling negative reviews

Respond publicly, fix privately.

**Public response (within 24h):**
"Thanks for feedback. We take this seriously. Please contact us at [email] to make things right."

**Private outreach:**
Solve the problem. Refund, free future booking, whatever makes sense. Many customers update reviews after good resolution.

## Advanced: review-triggered campaigns

Connect review platforms to email automation (via Zapier or similar):

1. New 5-star review posted ‚Üí Trigger email
2. Email thanks reviewer with discount code
3. Email asks permission to feature review in marketing
4. Follow-up email 2 months later: "Ready to book again?"

This requires technical setup but automates the entire review-to-rebooking loop.

## Measuring impact

Track in your booking notes:
- How many customers came via review platform discovery
- Discount code usage from reviewers
- Conversion rate difference for listings with 50+ vs 10 reviews

Most operators see 20-40% higher conversion rate once review count exceeds 50.

## Getting started

Start simple:
1. Add review request to post-trip email (this week)
2. Create reviewer discount codes (this week)  
3. Thank reviewers manually with codes (this month)
4. Automate once you prove the system works (next quarter)

Build review momentum now. Compounds over time.
