# Offer memberships or subscriptions

Create different customer types with specific rules and privileges to offer membership programs. While payment processing happens outside the system, Let's Book gives you powerful tools to manage what each member type can access and book.

## How it works

**Payment management:** Handle membership fees and subscriptions through your own payment system (bank transfers, external subscription service, etc.). Let's Book doesn't currently support integrated membership payments, but this may be added in future updates.

**System access:** Assign customers to specific member types in Let's Book with customized booking rules and restrictions

**Automated enforcement:** The system automatically applies the correct rules when members make bookings

## Setting up customer types

1. Go to [Customer Types](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/customer-types)
2. Create new member types (e.g., "Premium Member", "5-Ride Package", "Monthly Unlimited")
3. Configure booking conditions for each type
4. Assign customers to the appropriate member type

## Common membership models you can create

**Pay-per-use membership**

- Special reduced rates for members (e.g., 30% discount using pricing modifiers)
- Flexible booking with no long-term commitments
- Perfect for occasional users

**X-ride tickets**

- Set maximum number of bookings allowed (e.g., 5-ride, 10-ride packages)
- Define maximum duration per ride
- Great for structured pricing and gift packages

**Monthly/seasonal membership**

- Unlimited or high-limit bookings within timeframes
- Advanced booking privileges
- Ideal for regular boaters

**Loyalty programs**

- Manually assign loyal customer status to frequent bookers
- Tier-based benefits based on your own criteria
- Priority booking access
- Exclusive time slots or boat access

**Boat club membership**

- Premium access to specific boat types
- Extended booking windows
- Community-focused benefits
- Popular choice: Many existing boat clubs use Let's Book for their boat allocation and scheduling logic

## Standard booking conditions

For each customer type, you can set these basic conditions:

- **Allowed dock and boat combinations:** Restrict access to specific locations/boats
- **Allowed days:** Limit to certain days of the week
- **Excluded dates:** Block specific dates (holidays, maintenance days)
- **Minimum/maximum time booked ahead:** Control how far in advance they can book
- **Maximum booking duration:** Set trip length limits
- **Maximum bookings per day:** Prevent overbooking
- **Maximum boats per booking:** Control fleet access
- **Future booking limits:** Restrict how many upcoming bookings they can have
- **Monthly duration limits:** Cap total hours per month
- **Weekly duration limits:** Control usage on specific days of the week

## Advanced customization

Need more complex rules? You can create highly sophisticated conditions using AND/OR logic to handle virtually any membership scenario.

## Best practices

**Clear communication:** Make sure members understand their privileges and restrictions

**Test scenarios:** Verify your rules work as expected before launching

**Monitor usage:** Track how different member types use their privileges

**Regular review:** Adjust rules based on actual member behavior

**Support documentation:** Create guides for members explaining their benefits

## Member management workflow

1. **Setup:** Create customer types with appropriate rules
2. **Onboard:** Process membership payments outside the system
3. **Assign:** Add customers to the correct member type in Let's Book
4. **Monitor:** Track usage and adjust rules as needed
5. **Renew:** Handle renewals through your payment system, maintain member status in Let's Book

This approach gives you full control over pricing and payment terms while leveraging Let's Book's powerful rule engine to automate member privileges and restrictions.
