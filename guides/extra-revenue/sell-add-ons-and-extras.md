Turn every booking into extra revenue. Drinks, safety gear, insurance, food - all automatically offered during checkout.

## Why add-ons work

Customers already decided to rent. The marginal yes to extras is easier than the initial booking decision. Add-ons boost average transaction value with zero extra marketing.

## What sells well

**Safety and equipment:** Life jackets (extra sizes, kids), waterproof phone cases, coolers, fishing gear, wakeboard/ski equipment, navigation devices

**Food and drinks:** Drinks packages (beer, wine, soft drinks), snack boxes, picnic baskets, BBQ packages, ice and cups

**Insurance and protection:** Damage waiver (reduce liability), cancellation insurance, weather guarantee

**Services:** Fuel packages (prepaid), captain service, cleaning service, delivery to alternative pickup/dropoff location

**Special occasions:** Birthday decorations, celebration packages, photography service

## Setting up add-ons

Full setup guide in [create add-ons](/guides/settings/create-add-ons).

Key decisions:

**Layout style:** Grid (large photos) works best for visual items like drinks and gear. Bars (medium photos) for mixed content. Table (compact) for simple lists.

**Pricing:** Per booking, per person, per boat, or per hour. Insurance typically per booking, drinks per person.

**Questions:** Collect preferences like beer/wine ratio, vegetarian options, or t-shirt sizes.

**Availability conditions:** Control when add-ons show up - specific times, dates, docks, boat models, trip durations, or days of the week.

**Boat/dock specific:** Different add-ons for different boats or docks. Show premium items only on luxury boats, or dock-specific services.

## Boosting add-on sales

**Make them visible:** Show add-ons with attractive square photos. Grid layout with clear images beats text-only lists.

**Strategic pricing:** "‚Ç¨5 per person" sounds better than "‚Ç¨40 per group" even when identical.

**Seasonal offerings:** Summer - cooling, sun protection, water toys. Winter - heating, rain gear, hot drinks.

**Stock management:** Mark items as "out of stock" when unavailable instead of removing them entirely.
