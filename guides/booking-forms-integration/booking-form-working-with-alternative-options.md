# Booking form - working with alternative options

We’ve added a powerful new feature to avoid ‘dead ends’ in the booking flow: Smart Alternatives. If a boat is unavailable, we suggests a similar one from the same category — keeping customers on board and your calendar nicely filled.

To get started:

- Go to your boats, select a boat, and click Edit.
- You'll now see a Category dropdown. Use it to assign the boat to an existing category—or create a new one that fits your fleet.
- Want full control? You can turn off automatic suggestions per category or on the alternatives page.

If no boats are available that day, we’ll suggest alternative time slots or dates — so your customers stay in the flow.
