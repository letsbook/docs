# Configure your styling

## Styling for your brand

The booking form will sit right on top of your website – like it belongs there. The closer it matches your company
branding, the more likely customers are to hit that “book now” button. A consistent look and feel builds trust and makes
the whole booking (and sailing!) experience seamless.

To style it your way: head over to **Styling**

**1. Upload Logo**

Upload a horizontal version of your logo in JPG or PNG format with a minimum width of 320 px.

**2. Fonts**

Select fonts for titles and body text that align with your brand. You can choose from **Google Fonts**, including a
curated list of "featured fonts" recommended for the booking form. These options are optimized to ensure a consistent
and professional appearance.

**3. Brand Color**

Set a primary brand color that represents your identity. You can enter the HEX or RGB values directly or use the color
picker with the eyedropper tool.

**4. Interface Color**

Choose a color palette that complements your brand color. These shades will be applied to all interface elements with
supportive functions, ensuring a cohesive look.

**5. Corner Style**

Adjust the corner style for elements like buttons and background panels to match your design preferences.

Preview the styling to confirm everything looks as intended, including the booking flow. You can update and fine-tune
the styling anytime.
