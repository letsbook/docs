# Billing and invoices

[Go to Account Settings](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/account/plan)

## How billing works

When you go live, we meet to sign the contract and agree on which plan you'll start with. We set everything up, and from then on you receive monthly invoices via email.

**You get two invoices each month:**
- Invoice for your monthly subscription fee
- €0 invoice with an overview of booking fees paid that month

**Payment is year-round:** You pay monthly throughout the year. We know boat rentals are seasonal, but our team works year-round improving the platform.

## View your invoices

Download past invoices for your records:

1. Go to [Account Settings](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/account/plan)
2. Scroll to **Billing history**
3. Click any invoice to download PDF

## Payment methods

Pay with any supported payment method:
- Credit card
- Mobile Pay
- iDEAL
- Bank transfer
- Other local payment methods

**Update your payment method:**

1. Go to [Account Settings](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/account/plan)
2. Click **Update payment method**
3. Select and confirm your preferred method
4. Save changes

Your new payment method is charged at the next billing date.

## Payment failed?

If a payment doesn't go through:

1. Check your card details are correct
2. Make sure your card has sufficient funds
3. Update your payment method in [Account Settings](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/account/plan)

We'll retry charging automatically. Your account stays active during retry attempts.

## Billing cycle

**Standard Plan:** $30/month (€25/month) + 2.5% booking fee  
**Pro Plan:** $175/month (€150/month) + 1% booking fee
