# Change opening hours

Configure when customers can pick up and return boats. Opening hours control booking availability and automatically prevent reservations outside your operating times.

## Accessing opening hours settings

1. Go to your [general information](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/general-information)
2. Scroll down to the **Opening hours** section
3. Click **Edit** to modify your schedule

## Setting up your schedule

### Standard weekly hours

Configure your regular operating schedule for each day of the week:

**Day selection:** Click on any day to enable/disable it for operations

**Time ranges:** Set opening and closing times using the time picker
- Opening time: When first pickups can occur
- Closing time: When last returns must be completed

**Multiple time slots:** Add multiple time ranges for the same day if you have breaks or split shifts (e.g., 9:00-12:00 and 14:00-18:00)

### Same hours for multiple days

Use **"Copy to"** to quickly apply the same schedule across multiple days instead of setting each day individually.

### Closed days

Leave days unchecked or remove all time slots to mark them as closed. Customers won't see availability for closed days in the booking form.

## Special considerations

### Pickup vs return times

Opening hours apply to both pickup and return times. If a customer books a 4-hour rental starting at 16:00 and you close at 18:00, the system will prevent this booking since the return would be after closing.

### Timezone handling

Opening hours automatically use your dock's timezone. If you operate multiple locations across timezones, each dock can have different opening hours that display correctly for local customers.

### Buffer time

Consider setting closing times 30-60 minutes after your actual preferred end time to allow for late returns and equipment inspection.

## Holiday and seasonal schedules

For temporary schedule changes:

1. Create [blocked availability](../day-to-day/block-boat-availability.md) for specific dates
2. Use the dock-specific settings if only certain locations have different hours
3. Update your general hours when seasonal changes begin and end

Your opening hours changes take effect immediately and apply to all new bookings. Existing confirmed bookings remain unaffected even if they fall outside your new schedule.
