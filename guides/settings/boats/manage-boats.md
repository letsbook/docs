# Manage boats and fleet

Your boat fleet is the foundation of your rental business. Let's Book uses a two-tier system: boat models (the type customers see and book) and individual boats (specific units assigned to docks).

## Understanding the structure

**Boat models** are the types customers book (e.g., "Tender 6p", "Speedboat 8p") and contain descriptions, photos, and specifications. **Individual boats** are the actual physical units within each model (e.g., "Tender #1", "Tender #2") that get assigned to specific docks and schedules.

## Adding a new boat model

</div>

### Basic setup

**Capacity:** Keep it simple and include capacity like "Tender 6p" or "Speedboat 8p" - this is what customers see when booking. You can also limit how many boats of this model can be booked simultaneously (useful for managing fleet availability).

**Description:** Write compelling, informative text that highlights key features and benefits since this appears on booking forms.

**Photos:** Use horizontal JPG, PNG, or WebP format, crop them in advance using tools like [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/create/crop-photo/), and invest in high-quality images since they increase bookings.

**Specifications:** Add key details customers need at a glance like engine power, maximum speed, and included equipment.

### Categories and organization

Use categories to organize different boat types when you have many models (e.g., "Small boats", "Speedboats", "Luxury") so customers can filter options. Rearrange category order via the [rearrange page](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/models/rearrange) and add category descriptions that appear on the booking form. You can also configure the booking form to suggest alternative boats within the same category when a customer's first choice isn't available (manage this via [booking form alternatives](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/booking-form/alternatives)).

## Managing individual boats

After creating a boat model, set up the individual boats with unique names (like "Boat #1" or "Blue Thunder") and [assign them to specific docks](assign-boats-to-docks.md).

### Editing and removing boats

To edit a boat model, navigate to the specific boat model from your [boat models list](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/models) and click "Edit". Here you can update the boat name, capacity settings, category assignment, and descriptions.

To remove a boat model, click the three dots menu (â‹¯) in the options and select "Remove". Note that you can only delete boat models that don't have active bookings.

## Workflow summary

Plan your boat categories and naming, create boat models with photos and descriptions, organize categories and arrange order, add individual boats and assign to docks, then maintain through regular updates and service scheduling while optimizing based on booking patterns.
