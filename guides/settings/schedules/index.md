# Working with schedules

Schedules control when and how customers can book your boats. Choose the right schedule type to match your business model and give customers the booking experience you want.

## Schedule types

Let's Book offers two schedule approaches:

### Weekly schedule
Flexible booking within your operating hours. Customers pick trip duration from your predefined options and can start anytime during open hours.

You still control departure intervals (every 15, 30, or 60 minutes) and which trip lengths customers can choose from.

**Best for:**
- Maximum customer flexibility
- Day trips only

**Example:** Customers can book 2, 3, or 4-hour trips starting any time between 9 AM and 5 PM.

### Slot schedule  
Fixed departure times and durations. Customers choose from specific time slots you create.

**Best for:**
- Structured planning
- Multi-day rentals

**Example:** "Weekend adventure" Friday 4 PM to Sunday 6 PM, or "Morning trip" 10 AM to 1 PM daily.

## Choosing your approach

| Feature | Weekly Schedule | Slot Schedule |
|:--------|:----------------|:--------------|
| **Customer flexibility** | High - start anytime | Limited - fixed times only |
| **Multi-day trips** | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Full support |
| **Best for** | Flexible day trips | Structured packages |

## Getting started

1. **Choose your schedule type** based on your business needs:
   - [Set up weekly schedule](weekly-schedule) for flexible day trips
   - [Set up slot schedule](slot-schedule) for structured packages
2. **Follow the setup guide** for your chosen schedule type
3. **Connect your schedule** to boats and docks in [rental setup](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/rental-setup)

Most operators start with weekly schedules for simplicity, then add slot schedules for special packages or multi-day offerings.
