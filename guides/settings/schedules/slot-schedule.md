## Schedule name

Choose a descriptive internal name for your schedule. Customers won't see this name - it's purely for your organization.

**Example names:** "Summer weekend packages", "Multi-day adventures", "Morning fishing trips"

## Adding slots

Click **Add new** to create individual time slots for your schedule:

### Slot name

Give each slot a descriptive name that helps you organize different options.

**Examples:** "Early birds morning trip", "Weekend wanderlust", "Sunset cruise"

### Single day vs Multi-day slots

Choose the slot type using the toggle buttons:

**Single day:** Fixed start and end times on the same day
- **Pickup time:** When customers collect their boat (e.g., 10:00 AM)
- **Return time:** When they must bring it back (e.g., 6:00 PM)
- **Duration:** Automatically calculated (8 hours in this example)

**Multi-day:** Rentals spanning multiple days
- **Pickup time:** Start time on first day (e.g., Friday 10:00 AM) 
- **Return options:** Choose from preset options like "one night later", "2 nights later", up to "21 nights later"
- **Return time:** Final return time (e.g., Sunday 6:00 PM)

### Availability days

Set which days this slot is available:

- **Every day of the week:** Slot available daily
- **Specific days:** Choose particular days (Sunday through Saturday)

### Early pickup

Toggle to allow customers to collect boats before the scheduled pickup time:

- **Time options:** Set how early (5 minutes, hours, or days)
- **Units:** Choose Minutes, Hours, or Days (5 Ã— 24h)
- **Example:** "5 minutes early pickup" means a 10:00 AM slot allows 9:55 AM collection.

## Completing setup

1. **Save** your slot schedule after adding all desired slots
2. Set pricing for your slots in the [pricing section](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/pricing/slots/add)
3. Connect the schedule to boats and docks in [rental setup](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/rental-setup)

Slot schedules automatically prevent overlapping bookings and give you precise control over departure times and trip lengths.
