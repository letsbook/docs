# Limit pickups and returns

Control the operational flow at your dock by limiting how many boats can be picked up or returned simultaneously. This prevents bottlenecks and ensures smooth operations during busy periods.

These limits apply to each departure time individually. If your rental setup allows departures every 15 minutes, the restriction applies to each specific departure time (10:00, 10:15, 10:30, etc.).

## Accessing the setting

1. Go to your [docks overview](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/docks)
2. Click on the dock you want to configure
3. Click **Edit dock**
4. Scroll down to the **Pickups and returns** section

## Understanding the options

### Default behavior (unrestricted)

When the toggle is **off**, there are no limits on simultaneous operations - multiple boats can be picked up and returned at the same time.

### Restricted simultaneous operations

When you enable **"Limit the number of simultaneous pickups and/or returns"**, you can choose what to restrict:

**Limit simultaneous:**
- **Pickups** - Control how many boats can start their rental at the same time
- **Returns** - Control how many boats can end their rental at the same time
- **Pickups and returns** - Control the total combined number of pickups and returns happening simultaneously

**Restriction method:**

- **By number of bookings** - Limits customer groups arriving/departing simultaneously
- **By number of boats** - Limits physical boats being processed at once

## When to use each restriction

### By number of bookings

**Use when you want to limit:**
- How many customer groups arrive at the same time
- Staff workload during check-in/check-out processes
- Crowding at your dock facility

**Example scenario:**
Limit to 3 simultaneous pickups by bookings - even if those 3 groups rent 8 boats total, you only deal with 3 separate customer interactions.

### By number of boats

**Use when you want to limit:**
- Time spent on boat preparation, cleaning, and safety checks
- Physical handling of multiple boats
- Dock congestion from too many boats being moved

**Example scenario (pickups and returns combined):**
Limit to 4 simultaneous pickups and returns by boats - you could have 2 boats departing and 2 boats arriving, or 3 departing and 1 arriving, but never more than 4 total boats being processed.
