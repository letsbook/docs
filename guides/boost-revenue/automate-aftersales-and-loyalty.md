# Automate aftersales and loyalty

ðŸ‘‰ **[Manage notifications](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/notifications)** | **[Setup guide](/guides/settings/rental-setups/edit-customer-notifications)**

Send the right message at the right time. Automated emails drive reviews, repeat bookings, and upsells without manual work.

## Why email timing matters

Automate these touchpoints once, benefit forever. Customers are most receptive at specific moments: confirmation for upsells, 6 hours before for practical info, right after their trip for reviews, 50 weeks later for rebooking, and when canceled to keep the relationship alive.

## Available notification triggers

**[Email when confirmed](#when-confirmed-upsells-and-prep)** - Upsell opportunity

**[Email 6h before pickup](#6-hours-before-last-minute-details)** - Last-minute practical info

**[Email after the trip](#after-trip-reviews-and-thank-you)** - Strike while memory is fresh

**[Email after 50 weeks of inactivity](#50-weeks-later-win-them-back)** - Win back past customers

**[Email when canceled](#when-canceled-keep-the-relationship)** - Keep the relationship alive

Full list and setup: [edit customer notifications](/guides/settings/rental-setups/edit-customer-notifications)

## When confirmed: Upsells and prep

Booking confirmed. Customer is excited and engaged. Great moment for add-ons.

**Use cases:**

- Upsell add-ons: "90% of customers add the drinks package"
- Set expectations: "Here's what to expect on your trip"
- Social proof: "Join 5,000+ happy customers this season"
- What to bring: "Don't forget: ID, comfortable shoes, sunscreen"

**Example message:**
"Booking confirmed! Quick tip: most customers add our drinks package for â‚¬25 - it's available when you arrive at the dock. See you soon!"

## 6 hours before: Last-minute details

Customers check email before heading out. Perfect timing for practical info.

**Use cases:**

- Parking instructions and alternative routes
- What to bring: "Bring: sunscreen, water, towels, ID, comfortable shoes"
- Weather-specific tips: "Rain forecast - we provide rain gear" or "Sunny day - bring extra water"
- Merchandise preview: "Check out our new caps at the dock"
- Last-minute reminders: "Gates close 10 minutes before departure"

**Example message:**
"Your boat is ready tomorrow! Park at lot B (see map). Bring: sunscreen, water, comfortable shoes, and ID. We have cold drinks and snacks at the dock."

## After trip: Reviews and thank you

Best time to ask for reviews. Memory is fresh, emotions are positive, damage deposits returned.

**Use cases:**

- Request Google/TripAdvisor/Yelp review
- Offer discount code for next booking as thank you
- Collect feedback on experience

**Example message:**
"Loved your trip? Leave us a review on Google and get 10% off your next adventure: SUMMER10"

## 50 weeks later: Win them back

They haven't booked in almost a year. Automated reminder with incentive brings them back.

**Use cases:**

- Seasonal angle: "Remember last summer? Book your 2025 trip now"
- Exclusive offer: "We miss you! Here's 15% off as a welcome back gift"
- New features: "We added sunset tours since your last visit"
- Referral ask: "Know someone who'd love a boat trip?"

**Example message:**
"Almost a year since your last trip! Ready to get back on the water? Book this month and save 15%: WELCOME15"

## When canceled: Keep the relationship

Booking canceled. Don't lose the customer forever.

**Use cases:**

- Sorry it didn't work out: "Book again anytime with 10% off: RAINCHECK10"
- Collect feedback: "What made you cancel? Help us improve"
- Stay connected: "Follow us on Instagram for seasonal deals and boat life inspiration"

**Example message:**
"Sorry your plans changed! Your 10% discount is waiting when you're ready to reschedule: NEXTIME10. PS: Follow @yourboatcompany for deals and boat life."
