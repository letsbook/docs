# Generate bookings through partners

> **‚ö†Ô∏è FIRST DRAFT** - Lola check deze nog even goed.

üëâ **[Setup partner bookings](/guides/dive-deeper/partner-bookings)** | **[Pricing setup](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/pricing)**

Get your booking form on partner websites. Track which bookings come from which partner and set partner-specific retail rates to build in commission.

## Why work with partners

Reach customers through hotels, campsites, tourism boards, and partner websites. They send bookings, you handle operations. Everyone wins when pricing reflects the channel.

## Understanding pricing terms

**Retail rate:** The price customers pay when booking.

**Net rate:** What you receive after partner commission.

**Commission:** Percentage the partner earns for referring the booking.

**Example:** ‚Ç¨100 retail rate with 20% commission = ‚Ç¨80 net rate for you, ‚Ç¨20 commission for partner.

## How it works

Each partner gets a unique trackable URL. When customers book through that URL, the system automatically:
- Tags the booking with partner identifier
- Applies partner-specific pricing (if configured)
- Shows booking source in your dashboard

Full setup guide: [partner bookings](/guides/dive-deeper/partner-bookings)

## Setting partner-specific pricing

Build commission into retail rates so you receive your net rate automatically:

1. Go to [pricing](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/pricing)
2. Choose Slot pricing or Flexible pricing
3. Add a condition: "Booked via partner"
4. Select the partner identifier
5. Set higher retail rate to include commission

**Example in Flexible pricing:**

**Direct bookings:**
- Base rate: Duration in hours √ó ‚Ç¨50
- Customer pays **‚Ç¨50/hour retail rate**

**Partner bookings:**
- Base rate: Duration in hours √ó ‚Ç¨50
- Additional charge: Duration in hours √ó ‚Ç¨10
- Condition: Booked via partner ‚Üí "beachhotel"
- Customer pays **‚Ç¨60/hour retail rate**
- You receive ‚Ç¨60, keep ‚Ç¨50 net rate, pay partner ‚Ç¨10 commission

## Pricing strategies

**Built-in commission (recommended):** Include commission in retail rate shown to customers. Customer pays ‚Ç¨60, you keep ‚Ç¨50 net rate, pay partner ‚Ç¨10. Clean, automated, no invoicing hassle.

**Standard rate + separate commission:** Keep retail rate the same for all channels. Customer pays ‚Ç¨50, you receive ‚Ç¨50, then invoice or pay partner ‚Ç¨10 commission separately. Better conversion (lower price), more administrative work.

**Discount codes:** Combine partner tracking with [discount codes](/guides/extra-revenue/discount-codes-and-coupon-setup). Give customers a discount while still tracking which partner sent them.

## Commission structure guidelines

**20-30%:** Accommodations with captive audience (hotel guests, limited alternatives). Higher commission justified by exclusive access to customers.

**10-20%:** Tourism portals where customers comparison shop. Balance commission with competitive pricing.

**5-15%:** Marinas and yacht clubs. Premium audience but price-aware, they'll compare options.

Monitor conversion rates. If partner bookings drop significantly, retail rate might be too high relative to direct bookings.

## Best partner types

**Accommodations:** Hotels, B&Bs, campsites near water. Their guests need activities.

**Tourism organizations:** Official boards, regional portals. High-intent customers researching activities.

**Marinas and yacht clubs:** Premium audience already on water.

**Event planners:** Corporate retreats, team building, weddings. Group bookings.

**Concierge services:** High-end hotels, restaurants. Customers expect curated recommendations.

## Track partner performance

Identify which partnerships drive real value vs which ones just add complexity.

## Getting started

**Before approaching partners:**
- Calculate your required net rate per booking
- Decide on commission structure (10-20% is typical starting point)
- Set up tracking URLs (see [partner bookings setup](/guides/dive-deeper/partner-bookings))

**First 2-3 partners:**
- Start with standard pricing (no markup yet)
- Test the tracking system
- See actual booking volume
- Calculate real commission costs

**After proof of concept:**
- Add partner-specific pricing for high-volume partners
- Adjust commission levels based on booking value
- Negotiate better terms with successful partners

Don't overcomplicate at the start. Get a few partners working first, optimize later.
