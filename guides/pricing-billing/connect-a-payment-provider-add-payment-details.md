# Connect payment provider

## What's a payment provider

A payment provider (also called a PSP or payment service provider) allows you to accept payments from customers â€” including credit cards, iDEAL, bank transfers, and more.

ðŸ‘‰ You need to choose a provider before you can start receiving payments. This choice is final â€” switching later isnâ€™t possible.
