# Understand booking statuses

Bookings in LetsBook go through different statuses throughout their lifecycle. Understanding these statuses helps you manage your bookings effectively and know exactly where each booking stands.

## Available booking statuses

**Draft**

- Bookings that have been started but not yet completed
- Customer may still be in the booking process
- No payment has been processed yet

**In option**

- Bookings that are temporarily reserved
- Gives customers time to confirm their booking
- Typically has an expiration time

**Confirmed**

- Bookings that have been finalized by the customer
- Payment has been processed (full or deposit)
- These bookings count towards your capacity

**Completed**

- Bookings where the trip has taken place
- The service has been delivered
- Final status for successful bookings

**Expired**

- Bookings that were in option but weren't confirmed within the time limit
- Draft bookings that weren't completed
- No longer active

**Canceled**

- Bookings that have been canceled by either customer or operator
- May involve refunds depending on your cancellation policy

## Status workflow

The typical booking flow follows this pattern:

1. **Draft** → Customer starts booking process
2. **In option** → Booking is temporarily reserved (optional step)
3. **Confirmed** → Customer completes booking and payment
4. **Completed** → Trip takes place successfully

Alternative paths:

- **Draft** → **Expired** (if not completed in time)
- **In option** → **Expired** (if not confirmed in time)
- **Confirmed** → **Canceled** (if booking is canceled)

## Managing different statuses

- **Focus on Confirmed bookings** for operational planning
- **Monitor Expired bookings** to identify lost opportunities
- **Track Completed bookings** for performance analysis
- **Review Canceled bookings** to understand cancellation patterns
