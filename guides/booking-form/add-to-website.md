# Add the booking form to your website

Adding the booking form is really easy. All it takes are these two steps:

Using WordPress, Wix or Squarespace? Weâ€™ve got specific guides for those platforms!

## 1. Add this code to your website

Place the following script in your website, ideally in the`<head>` section, but it also works elsewhere.

```
<!-- Start of Let's Book widget -->
<script src="https://cdn.letsbook.app/assets/lb-widgets.min.js" type="module" defer></script>
<!-- End of Let's Book widget -->
```

## 2. Link to your booking form

Create a button, image, or text link to your unique booking form URL. You can find this link in Step 2 of your [booking form settings](https://dashboard.letsbook.test/booking-form/integration-instructions). Here you can also pick from many automatic preselects like language, boat model or dock. You can also show things like the login panel or coupon code form immediately when showing the booking form.

:::note[Partner Bookings]
Allow partners to embed the booking form directly onto their website. This makes it easy for you to track bookings coming from their website. Learn more
