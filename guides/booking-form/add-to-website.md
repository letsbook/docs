# Add the booking form to your website

Add the booking form in two quick steps.

:::note
Using [WordPress](./integrate-with-wordpress.md), [Wix](./integrate-with-wix.md), or [Squarespace](./integrate-with-squarespace.md)? See our platform-specific guides.
:::

## Add the script

Add the script tag to your site. Prefer the `<head>` section; other places work too.

```html
<!-- Start of Let's Book widget -->
<script
    src="https://cdn.letsbook.app/assets/lb-widgets.min.js"
    type="module"
    defer
></script>
<!-- End of Let's Book widget -->
```

## Link to your booking form

Add a button, image, or text link to your unique booking form URL. Find it in Step 2 of your [booking form settings](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/booking-form/integration-instructions). Use preselects (language, boat model, dock) and optional panels (login, coupon) to tailor the first view.

:::note[Partner Bookings]
Let partners embed your booking form on their site to track referral bookings.
