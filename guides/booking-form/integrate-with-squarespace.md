# Embed our booking form in Squarespace

In 3 steps you can make the form appear on your Squarespace website:

1. Go to the embeds in your dashboard and copy the code shown in step 1.
2. Log in to Squarespace, and use the menu to navigate to Pages > Website tools (might have to scroll to the bottom) > Code-injection
3. Go to the input field for the 'header' section and paste the Booking Form code. Hit 'Save'.

To link to the booking form on your website, use the URL provided in step 2. This will open the booking form when clicked.
