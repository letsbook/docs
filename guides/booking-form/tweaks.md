# Tweak the form

## Date picker

Set the calendar to match how you rent. Customers can still switch between single day and multi day on the form.

- Go to [Booking form > Date picker](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/booking-form/date-picker)
- Pick one, then click Save
    - Smart (default): Lets Book chooses the best view per rental. Not sure? Leave it on Smart. Set it once and get back to the fun part of running a marina.
    - Primarily single day: Best if most bookings are hourly or sameâ€‘day.
    - Primarily multi day: Best for weekend or multi day charters.

## Phone number

Control whether customers must enter a phone number at checkout.

- Go to [Booking form > Phone number](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/booking-form/phone-number-requirement)
- Choose the field rule, then click Save
    - Required: Pick this if you coordinate last minute changes or dockside handoffs.
    - Optional (default): Keeps checkout fast for quick bookings.
    - Hidden: Use this if you collect numbers in your waiver or CRM instead.

## Tax / VAT settings

Set how prices appear to customers on the booking form.

- Go to [Booking form > Pricing settings](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/booking-form/pricing)
- Choose how prices are displayed, then click Save
    - Including tax: Show prices with tax included everywhere while composing a booking. Easiest for most operators.
    - Excluding tax: Show prices before tax during booking. Customers see the final total, including tax, on the last step of the booking form. Often used by American companies.
