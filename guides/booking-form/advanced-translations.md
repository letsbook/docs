# Advanced translations

Through the system, you can easily insert variables into your text. This ensures that the correct details are automatically added to the content. We use the [ICU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Components_for_Unicode) standard

## Variables

Through the system, you can easily insert variables into your text. This ensures that the correct details are automatically added to the content.

- Simply click the green button (+) and select the desired variable.
- In the notifications section, where you manage your emails, you can take it a step further: add buttons, images, and content blocks for a more polished and engaging message.

\*Note that variables (words within `\{}`) should not be translated. However, if a variable contains another variable (e.g., `\{xxx \{yyy}}`), only translate the inner content `\{yyy}`.
