# Offer alternatives when boats are fully booked

We’ve added a powerful new feature to avoid ‘dead ends’ in the booking flow: Smart Alternatives. If a boat is unavailable, we suggests a similar one from the same category, keeping customers on board and your calendar nicely filled.

## Different boat model as alternative

We consider boats from the same category to be valid subtitudes for each other. So in order for it to work, they need to be in the same category.

1. Make sure your boats are assigned to a category by editing them from your [boat models](https://dashboard.letsbook.test/models) page.
1. Decide which categories should be looking for [alternatives](https://dashboard.letsbook.test/booking-form/alternatives) with their category.

## Different times and dates

By default, if no boats are available that day, we’ll suggest alternative time slots or dates. This makes sure your customers stay in the flow and always find a suitable moment. We first try to find a suitable time and if that fails, we'll look for a different date the next day, the next week and so on.

## Disabling alternative

Don't want alternatives that may confuse your customers? You can turn off automatic suggestions per category or on the [alternatives](https://dashboard.letsbook.test/booking-form/alternatives) page.
