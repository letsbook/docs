# Pick supported languages

We support virtually any language that is left-to-right for the booking form, allowing your customers to book in a familiar language. 

## Adding a new language

Go [text & languages](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/localization) and find the 'My languages' section for a list of the languages currently in use. Click the add language button. We provide 6 language packs that have been thoroughly reviewed and verified. Additionally, we offer 5 AI-translated language packs. While these have been translated using advanced AI tools, there may be minor errors. If you come across any incorrect translations, weâ€™d greatly appreciate it if you let us know!

## Adding a language that's not supported out of the box
YOu can still do this, but you'll need to translate the interface yourself using [overrides](#managing-texts).

Choose a starting point for your translations when adding an unsupported language:

1. Start by [adding a language](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/localization/languages/add) and find the select box labeled "Translate manually." Choose your desired language.
1. Select a "Fallback Language" to use as a starting point. This allows you to build on the text you've already created in another language, which is especially helpful if you've made many edits to the existing copy.
1. If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new translation from scratch. While doing so, you'll have access to the reference text to guide you as you translate.

## Removing a language

You can remove a language. Not that any custom translations will be removed along with it. Additionally, customers having this language configured as their preferred language will be migrated to your default language.

You cannot remove your default language
