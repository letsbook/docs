# Sync planning with personal calendar

See your bookings automatically appear in your personal calendar by connecting Let's Book to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook. Stay up to date with your schedule wherever you are.

## How it works

Let's Book generates a unique calendar feed link for your account that syncs your booking schedule with your external calendar app. This is a view-only connection - you can see your bookings but cannot edit them from your personal calendar.

**What gets synced:**

- Bookings from the past 7 days
- Bookings for the next 30 days
- Automatic updates based on your calendar app's refresh settings

**Update frequency:**

- **Google Calendar:** Updates every 12 hours automatically
- **Apple Calendar:** You control the refresh rate (minimum 5 minutes)
- **Outlook:** Depends on your local settings

## Good to know

**Sync interval:** Bookings sync automatically based on your calendar app's settings. We sync data 7 days back and 30 days ahead.

**View-only:** You can see your bookings in your personal calendar but cannot edit them there. Changes must be made in Let's Book.

**Compatibility:** Some calendar apps (like Samsung Calendar) don't accept calendar feeds directly. In these cases, add the feed to Google Calendar first, then sync Google Calendar with your preferred app.

**Multiple calendars:** You can add the same feed to multiple calendar apps if you use different devices.

This calendar sync keeps you informed about your booking schedule whether you're at your desk or on the go, ensuring you never miss an important booking or appointment.
