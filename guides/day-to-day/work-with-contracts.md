# Work with contracts

Use our waiver integration to collect signatures on your rental agreement and other documents. If you have not set it up yet, start with the [setup guide](../settings/waivers/set-up-waivers.md).

## How it works for customers

- After payment, the renter lands on the booking details page.
- The page shows a clear prompt to sign the contract.

- When the renter clicks "Sign", we open the WaiverForever document.
- After signing, it can take up to one minute for the signed status to appear on the booking page.

## Track signatures in the dashboard

Open any booking from the [Bookings overview](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/bookings) to see who signed the contract.

:::info[Tip]
Use the Document filter on the [Bookings overview](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/bookings) to find all bookings still awaiting signatures.

If the customer arrives without signing, open the form for them with the "Show form" button. Or have them scan the QR code on their own device.

## Remind your customers

Right after booking, renters are excited. A short reminder helps.

- Mention the rental agreement in your booking confirmation email.
- Add a button that links to the booking details page. It always shows the latest signing status.

Once this is in place, waivers are fully integrated into your Let's Book setup.
