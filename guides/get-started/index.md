## Step 1: Set your general information

👉 **[Start here: General Information](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/general-info)**

**First things first** - let's establish your business basics. This information will appear throughout your booking system and in communications with customers.

**What you'll configure:**

- **Company name and contact details** - Your business identity that appears on all customer communications
- **Business address and location** - Physical location details for customer reference and legal requirements
- **Terms and conditions** - Legal agreements that customers must accept before booking
- **Privacy policy settings** - GDPR compliance and data handling preferences
- **Default language and currency** - Localization settings for your target market

**Pro tip:** Take your time with this step - these details will be visible to all your customers and help build trust in your rental business.

---

## Step 2: Compose your notifications

👉 **[Configure notifications](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/notifications)**

**Stay connected** with your customers through automated notifications. Set up email templates for different booking scenarios.

**Key notifications to configure:**

- **Booking confirmation emails** - Automatic confirmations sent immediately after successful bookings
- **Payment confirmations** - Receipt emails for processed payments and deposits
- **Booking changes and cancellations** - Updates when customers or you modify existing bookings
- **Reminder emails before rental dates** - Helpful reminders sent 24-48 hours before rental start
- **Custom messages for special situations** - Personalized templates for weather delays, maintenance issues, etc.

**Why this matters:** Professional, timely communication builds customer confidence and reduces support inquiries.

---

## Step 3: Create a dock to store your boats

👉 **[Create your first dock](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/docks/add)**

**Organize your fleet** by creating docks - these are locations where your boats are stored and where customers will pick them up.

**What you can set up:**

- **Multiple dock locations** - Separate facilities for different areas or boat types
- **Dock names and descriptions** - Clear identifiers and helpful details for customers
- **Address and GPS coordinates** - Precise location data for navigation and pickup instructions
- **Special instructions for customers** - Parking information, access codes, contact persons

**Planning ahead:** Even if you only have one location now, setting up docks properly makes it easy to expand later.

---

## Step 4: Add your boats and assign them to the dock

👉 **[Add your boats](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/models/add)**

**Time to add your fleet!** This is where you'll input all the details about each boat you want to rent out.

**For each boat, you'll configure:**

- **Boat name and description** - Memorable names and detailed descriptions to help customers choose
- **Technical specifications** - Length, capacity, engine type, fuel requirements, and performance details
- **High-quality photos** - Multiple angles showing exterior, interior, and key features
- **Dock assignment** - Which dock location each boat is stored at and available from
- **Special features and equipment included** - GPS, fishing equipment, safety gear, audio systems, etc.

**Photography tip:** Great photos are crucial - they're often the deciding factor for customers choosing between rental options.

**Need more details?** Check our comprehensive guides on [managing boats and fleet](../boats/manage-boats.md) and [assigning boats to docks](../boats/assign-boats-to-docks.md).

---

## Step 5: Set up when the boats are available for rental

👉 **[Set up schedules](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/schedules)**

**Control your availability** by creating weekly rental schedules. This determines when customers can book your boats.

**Schedule options:**

- **Weekly recurring availability** - Set standard operating hours for each day of the week
- **Seasonal adjustments** - Different schedules for summer/winter or peak/off-peak periods
- **Holiday schedules** - Special availability for public holidays and local events
- **Maintenance periods** - Block out time for boat servicing and repairs
- **Custom availability rules** - Override defaults for specific dates or special circumstances

**Best practice:** Start with conservative availability hours and expand as you get comfortable with operations.

---

## Step 6: Decide on your pricing

👉 **[Configure pricing](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/pricing)**

**Set your rates** with flexible pricing options that can adapt to different seasons, durations, and demand.

**Pricing features:**

- **Base hourly/daily rates** - Standard pricing for different rental durations
- **Seasonal pricing adjustments** - Higher rates during peak season, lower during off-season
- **Weekend and holiday premiums** - Increased pricing for high-demand periods
- **Multi-day discounts** - Incentives for longer rental periods
- **Dynamic pricing rules** - Advanced rules based on availability, demand, or booking timing

**Strategy tip:** Research local competitors and consider your costs (fuel, maintenance, insurance) when setting prices.

---

## Step 7: Configure when a booking is confirmed

👉 **[Set confirmation methods](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/confirmation-methods)**

**Decide your confirmation flow** - when do bookings become official and how do customers receive confirmation?

**Confirmation options:**

- **Instant confirmation upon payment** - Bookings are automatically confirmed when payment is processed
- **Manual approval process** - You review and approve each booking before confirmation
- **Deposit-based confirmation** - Bookings confirmed after partial payment, with balance due later
- **Custom confirmation rules** - Different confirmation methods based on boat type, duration, or customer history

**Consider your workflow:** Choose a method that fits your availability to review bookings and your customers' expectations.

---

## Step 8: Bind it all together in the rental setup

👉 **[Build your rental setup](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/rental-setup)**

**Connect all the pieces** by creating your rental flow. This combines boats, pricing, schedules, and settings into a bookable experience.

**What gets connected:**

- **Available boats and their schedules** - Link your fleet with their availability windows
- **Pricing rules and calculations** - Apply your pricing strategy to the booking flow
- **Booking flow and requirements** - Define the steps customers go through to complete bookings
- **Customer information collection** - Specify what details you need from renters
- **Terms and conditions acceptance** - Ensure customers agree to your policies before booking

**This is the magic step:** Everything you've configured so far comes together into your actual booking system.

---

## Step 9: Customize your styling

👉 **[Customize styling](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/styling)**

**Make it yours** by customizing the look and feel of your booking interface to match your brand.

**Styling options:**

- **Color schemes and branding** - Match your website colors and brand identity
- **Logo and imagery** - Upload your business logo and background images
- **Font choices** - Select typography that reflects your brand personality
- **Layout preferences** - Choose how information is displayed and organized
- **Mobile responsiveness** - Ensure great experience across all device types

**Branding matters:** A professional, cohesive appearance builds trust and can justify premium pricing.

---

## Step 10: Connect your payment provider

👉 **[Connect payment provider](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/styling)** _(Note: This links to the payment setup section)_

**Get paid securely** by connecting a payment provider to handle customer transactions safely.

**Payment setup:**

- **Connect Stripe or Mollie** - Integration with trusted payment processors
- **Configure accepted payment methods** - Credit cards, debit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers
- **Set up payout schedules** - How often funds are transferred to your business account
- **Test payment processing** - Verify transactions work correctly before going live

**Security first:** Using integrated payment providers ensures PCI compliance and customer trust.

---

## 🧪 Testing phase: Before you go live

Before accepting real bookings, thoroughly test your setup:

**Test scenarios:**

- Complete a successful booking from start to finish
- Try a failed payment scenario
- Test booking modifications and cancellations
- Verify all notification emails are working
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Confirm pricing calculations are accurate

**Fine-tuning:** Use this testing phase to adjust availability, pricing, or messaging based on the user experience.
