      `pricing_structure` costs are automatically calculated from the 
      pricing settings. This is usually the rental of the boat. 

      `manual` is used when the cost is manually added to the booking by a 
      staf member.
      
      `add_on` costs are costs linked to an order line of an add-ons order.
      
      `coupon` is usually a negative cost as it is a discount, given by using 
      a coupon code.
