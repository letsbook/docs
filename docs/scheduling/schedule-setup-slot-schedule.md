# Schedules - Setup slot schedule

## Walkthrough

To set up a slot schedule with slots within a day (for fixed departure times and durations), go to the schedules overview page and click "add slot schedule".

### 1. Slot schedule setup

A slot schedule is a collection of slots that occur throughout the week. Choose a name that clearly indicates the purpose of the schedule (customers will not see this name). For example, you could name it "Default summer slots".

To create slots for this schedule, click "Add new" and set up the timeline for the slot.

You can also give customers the option to pick up the boat before the initial pick-up time (10 minutes in this example).
