# Set up flexible pricing

Flexible pricing uses formulas and conditions to create dynamic rates based on multiple variables. Perfect for complex pricing strategies and seasonal adjustments.

  <a href="https://dashboard.letsbook.app/pricing/flexible/add" class="button button--primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create flexible pricing</a>
</div>

## Basic setup

**Name:** Choose an internal name for this pricing structure.

**Customer display line:** Customize what customers see on the booking form. Use the **+** button to add variables.

**Tax settings:** Choose whether prices include or exclude tax, and select your tax rate.

## Rental pricing

Set your base pricing calculation method:

### Pricing methods

**Formula:** Calculate rates based on variables

- Duration in hours
- Duration in days (24h periods)
- Number of passengers in booking
- Number of passengers on a boat
- Hours booked in advance
- Days booked in advance
- Number of nights

**Example:** $100 per hour base rate = select "Duration in hours" and enter 100.

**Fixed amount:** One set price regardless of variables. Add conditions to make it dynamic.

**Table:** Create rate tables similar to simple pricing, with added condition support.

### Adding pricing conditions

Click **Add condition** to create complex rules.

**Example pricing structure:**

**Base rate:** $100/hour for all rentals

**Weekend surcharge:** +$20/hour on Saturdays and Sundays

- Condition: Days of the week = Saturday, Sunday
- Price: +$20 per hour

**Member discount:** -$40/hour for members

- Condition: Customer type = Member
- Price: -$40 per hour

**Result:**

- Weekday non-member: $100/hour
- Weekend non-member: $120/hour
- Weekday member: $60/hour
- Weekend member: $80/hour

**Available conditions:**

- **Booking duration:** Different rates for trip length
- **Number of boats:** Bulk discounts or premiums
- **Number of passengers:** Group size adjustments
- **Customer type:** Different rates for members vs guests
- **Days of the week:** Weekend vs weekday pricing
- **Time period:** Different rates for specific hours (e.g., 10 AM-1 PM)
- **Booked in advance:** Early bird or last-minute pricing
- **Every nth boat:** Apply discounts to every 2nd, 3rd boat, etc.
- **Nth boat:** Special rate for specific boat position (e.g., 3rd boat free)
- **Booked via partner:** Different rates for partner bookings

## Additional charges

Add extra costs beyond base pricing:

**Name:** Internal reference
**Customer display:** What customers see during booking
**Tax settings:** Include/exclude tax and rate

**Price calculation:**

- **Formula:** Calculate based on variables
- **Fixed amount:** Set fee (e.g., $30 cleaning charge)
- **Table:** Variable rates with conditions

**Advanced mode:** Use complex formulas with multiple variables and calculations. See [Working with pricing formulas](../../dive-deeper/pricing-formulas) for detailed formula syntax.

## Deposits

Secure bookings with refundable deposits.

- **Name:** Internal reference (e.g., "Deposit")
- **Customer display:** What customers see on booking form (e.g., "Deposit; will be refunded within 3 days")
- **Tax settings:** Include/exclude tax and rate

**Price options:**

- **Formula:** Calculate based on variables (e.g., 20% of rental price)
- **Fixed amount:** Set amount (e.g., $100.00)
- **Table:** Different deposits for different scenarios

**Example:** Fixed $100 deposit, refunded within 3 days after return.

Add conditions to apply deposits only in specific situations.

## Completing setup

1. **Save** your flexible pricing structure
2. Test calculations with sample bookings to ensure formulas work correctly
3. Apply to boat-dock combinations in [rental setup](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/rental-setup)

Flexible pricing gives you complete control over dynamic rates but requires careful testing to ensure calculations work as expected across all booking scenarios.
