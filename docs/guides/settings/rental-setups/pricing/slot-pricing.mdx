# Set up slot pricing

Slot pricing sets fixed rates for specific time slots and packages. Connect prices directly to your slot schedules for structured rental offerings.

    </a>
</div>

## Prerequisites

Create a [slot schedule](../schedules/slot-schedule) first. Slot pricing connects to existing schedules and sets rates for each time slot.

## Basic setup

**Name:** Choose an internal name for this pricing structure (e.g., "Peak season pricing").

**Slot schedule:** Select which slot schedule these prices apply to (e.g., "Summer slots"). Yellow dots indicate slots without pricing.

**Tax settings:** Choose whether prices include or exclude tax, and select your tax rate.

## Setting slot prices

Click on each slot to set its individual price. Each time slot in your schedule needs its own rate.

**Single day slots:** Set one price per slot

- "Morning cruise" (9:00-12:00): $150
- "Afternoon adventure" (13:00-17:00): $200
- "Sundowner" (18:00-21:00): $180
- "Full day explorer" (9:00-19:00): $350

**Multi-day slots:** Set the full package price

- "Weekend getaway" (Saturday 10:00 - Sunday 18:00): $600

## Pricing elements

Add costs on top of base slot prices:

**Per passenger charges:** Extra cost for each person (e.g., €5 per passenger).
**Multi-boat discounts:** Reduced rates when booking multiple boats simultaneously.
**Equipment fees:** Additional gear or service charges.

### Adding pricing elements

1. Click **Add pricing element**
2. Choose calculation type:
    - **Formula:** Based on variables like passenger count
    - **Fixed amount:** Set fee per booking
    - **Table:** Different rates for different scenarios
3. Add conditions if needed (e.g., only apply for groups over 6 people)

## Additional charges

Calculate extra costs beyond slot and element pricing.

**Name:** Internal reference (e.g., "Passenger surcharge")

**Customer display:** What customers see (e.g., "Extra charge per passenger")

**Tax settings:** Include/exclude tax and rate

**Charge options:**

- **Formula:** Calculate based on booking variables (e.g., Number of passengers × $5.00)
- **Fixed amount:** Set price (e.g., $25 equipment fee)
- **Table:** Variable rates based on conditions

**Example:** Charge $5.00 per passenger, added on top of the base slot price.

## Deposits

Secure bookings with refundable deposits.

- **Name:** Internal reference (e.g., "Deposit")
- **Customer display:** What customers see on booking form (e.g., "Deposit; will be refunded within 3 days")
- **Tax settings:** Include/exclude tax and rate

**Price options:**

- **Formula:** Calculate based on variables (e.g., 20% of rental price)
- **Fixed amount:** Set amount (e.g., $100.00)
- **Table:** Different deposits for different scenarios

**Example:** Fixed $100 deposit, refunded within 3 days after return.

Add conditions to apply deposits only in specific situations.

## Advanced features

**Multiple price parts:** Create complex pricing structures with different calculation methods combined.

**Conditional pricing:** Apply different rates based on:

- Booking duration or advance time
- Customer type (member vs guest)
- Number of passengers or boats
- Seasonal periods
- Days of the week

## Completing setup

1. **Save** your slot pricing structure
2. Apply it to boat-dock combinations in [rental setup](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/rental-setup)
3. Test the booking flow to ensure slot prices display correctly

Slot pricing automatically prevents double-booking and gives you complete control over package rates and availability.
