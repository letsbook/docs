**Mobile-first:**
Most customers check email on phones. Test mobile view.

**Clear CTAs:**
Use obvious button text like "View booking" not "Click here".

**Consistent timing:**
Stick to notification schedule. Don't send too many emails.

**Professional tone:**
Match your brand voice but keep it professional and clear.
