# Set up slot schedule

Slot schedules offer fixed departure times and trip durations. Perfect for multi-day rentals, guided trips, or structured packages.

</div>

## Schedule name

Choose a descriptive internal name for your schedule. Customers won't see this name - it's purely for your organization.

**Example names:** "Summer slots", "Winter slots", "Weekend packages"

## Adding slots

Click **Add new** to create individual time slots for your schedule.

### Slot name

Give each slot a descriptive name that helps you organize different options.

**Examples for Summer slots:**
- "Morning cruise" - Early start (9:00-12:00)
- "Afternoon adventure" - Midday departure (13:00-17:00)
- "Sundowner" - Evening trip (18:00-21:00)
- "Full day explorer" - All-day rental (9:00-19:00)
- "Weekend getaway" - Multi-day (Saturday 10:00 - Sunday 18:00)

### Single day vs Multi-day slots

Choose the slot type using the toggle buttons:

**Single day:** Fixed start and end times on the same day

- **Pickup time:** When customers collect their boat (e.g., 10:00 AM)
- **Return time:** When they must bring it back (e.g., 6:00 PM)
- **Duration:** Automatically calculated (8 hours in this example)

- **Return options:** Choose from preset options like "one night later", "2 nights later", up to "21 nights later"

### Availability days

Set which days this slot is available:

- **Every day of the week:** Slot available daily
- **Specific days:** Choose particular days (Sunday through Saturday)

### Early pickup

Toggle to allow customers to collect boats before the scheduled pickup time:

- **Time options:** Set how early (5 minutes, hours, or days)
- **Units:** Choose Minutes, Hours, or Days (5 Ã— 24h)
- **Example:** "5 minutes early pickup" means a 10:00 AM slot allows 9:55 AM collection.

## Completing setup

2. Set pricing for your slots in the [pricing section](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/pricing/slots/add)
