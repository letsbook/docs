# Set up weekly schedule

Weekly schedules let customers book trips within your operating hours. Set the times boats are available and define trip duration options.

<Button href="https://dashboard.letsbook.app/schedules/week/add">Create new weekly schedule</Button>

## Schedule name

Choose a clear internal name for your schedule. This helps you organize multiple schedules but customers won't see this name.

**Examples:** "Summer hours", "Weekend schedule", "Main dock availability"

## Set your timeline

Define when boats can be picked up and returned using the timeline interface.

**Operating hours:** Set your opening and closing times for when boats are available.

**Example:** 10 AM to 6 PM means customers can pick up anytime from 10:00 but must return by 18:00.

**Split schedule (lunch break):** Create separate time blocks for morning and afternoon (like 9 AM-12 PM and 2 PM-6 PM). Click **Add time** to add additional slots. This prevents new pickups during your break while allowing existing rentals to continue.

**Different days:** Configure each day of the week separately or copy settings across multiple days.

## Trip duration options

Choose how customers select trip length:

### Fixed lengths

Offer specific duration choices like 2, 3, 4, or 6 hours.

**Highlighted options:** Mark your preferred durations to stand out on the booking form.

**Pickup frequency:** Set how often trips can start (every 15, 30, or 60 minutes).

### Within range

Let the system generate all possible durations between your minimum and maximum.

**Example:** 2-6 hour range creates options for 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6-hour trips.

Choose fixed lengths for simpler choice, or within range for maximum flexibility.

## Advanced settings

### Early pickup

Allow customers to collect boats before their scheduled pickup time. Useful for eager customers or operational flexibility.

### Margins around bookings

Add buffer time after each trip for boat cleaning or late returns.

**Example:** 30-minute margin gives you cleanup time between rentals and handles boats returned slightly late.

2. Go to [rental setup](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/rental-setup) to connect this schedule to specific boat and dock combinations
3. Test the booking flow to ensure times and durations work as expected
