# Set opening hours

Your opening hours are defined by your schedules. Create slots with specific times to control when customers can pick up and return boats.

## How schedules control availability

Schedules determine your operating hours through:

**Slot times** - When boats can be picked up and returned

**Booking windows** - In weekly schedules, the time range when bookings are available

**Rental duration** - Customers can only book if pickup + rental duration fits within your schedule

## Creating a split-day schedule

Example: Open 9-12 and 14-18 for bookings, but allow boats on water 9-18.

**Key points:**

- Morning slot: 9:00-12:00 pickup, allows rentals until 18:00
- Afternoon slot: 14:00-18:00 pickup, allows rentals until 18:00
- Gap 12:00-14:00: No pickups, but existing rentals continue
- Boats can be on water continuously 9:00-18:00

## Schedule types

### Slot-based schedules

Define exact pickup times (e.g., 9:00, 11:00, 14:00, 16:00). Customers select from available slots.

### Weekly schedules

Set a booking window (e.g., 9:00-18:00). Customers pick any time within that range.

## Multiple schedules

Create different schedules for:

- **Seasonal hours** - Summer vs winter operating times
- **Weekday vs weekend** - Different availability patterns
- **Special events** - Temporary schedule changes

Assign schedules to dock-boat combinations in [rental setup](/guides/settings/rental-setups/understanding-rental-setup).

## Tips

**Buffer time:** End your last slot 30-60 minutes before actual closing to allow for returns and inspection.

**Lunch breaks:** Use separate morning/afternoon slots to block midday pickups while allowing ongoing rentals.

**Timezone:** Schedules automatically use your dock's timezone for accurate local times.

**Immediate effect:** Schedule changes apply instantly to new bookings. Existing reservations remain valid.
