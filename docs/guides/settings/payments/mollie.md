Mollie redirects you back to your Let's Book dashboard once the connection succeeds.

### 6. Complete Mollie onboarding if prompted

Sometimes Mollie needs more information to activate payouts. You can usually accept payments immediately, although payouts only start after you finish onboarding.

- If you see the message "Before you can receive payments, Mollie needs more information," follow the link to complete onboarding
- Provide any requested KYC details and bank account verification

### 7. Choose the right profile

If you manage multiple websites or brands, choose the correct Mollie profile for this Let's Book environment.

- Open Integrations in Let's Book and verify the selected profile matches your live site

### 8. Understand verification and payouts

Mollie may perform extra verification. Payments can succeed while verification is pending. Payouts start after Mollie approves your account.

- Keep taking bookings without interruption
- Expect your first payout once all checks are completed

## Go live

When you are ready to accept real payments, set the integration to Live.

- Go to the [Integrations](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/integrations)
