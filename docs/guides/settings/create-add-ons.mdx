### Basic information

**Name and descriptions:** Use clear names customers will recognize. The short description appears on overview pages, long description on detail pages.

**Categories:** Group similar add-ons (e.g. "Drinks", "Equipment", "Food") to organize your booking form.

**Photos:** Upload square images (JPG or PNG). The first photo shows on overview pages. [Crop photos online](https://www.befunky.com/create/crop-photo/) for best results.

### Pricing and limits

Set price per item with optional quantity limits:

- **Per booking** - Maximum items per entire booking
- **Per boat** - Limit based on boat capacity
- **Per passenger** - Items per person
- **Per passenger per hour** - Useful for consumables (e.g. 2 beers per person per hour)

### Availability conditions

Control when add-ons are available by setting conditions:

- **Between times** - Limit to specific hours (e.g. breakfast 8-10am)
- **Between dates** - Only offer seasonal items during certain periods
- **Only at dock using boat model** - Restrict to specific location and boat combinations
- **Days of the week** - Weekend-only specials or weekday offers
- **Trip duration** - Require minimum rental length for premium add-ons
- **Minimum time upfront** - Set lead time for items needing preparation
