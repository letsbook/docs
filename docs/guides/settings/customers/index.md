# Customer types

Customer types let you create different booking experiences for different groups of customers. Set specific rules, restrictions, and permissions based on who's booking.

## Default customer types

Every Let's Book account starts with two built-in customer types:

**Guest** - Customers who book without creating an account. They receive confirmation emails but can't log in to manage their bookings.

**Member** - Customers who create an account during or after booking. Members can log in to view booking history, manage reservations, and update their details.

## Why use customer types

Different customers need different rules:

- **Boat club members** get priority booking and no deposits
- **Casual renters** need advance payment and stricter cancellation
- **Corporate clients** have monthly limits and custom pricing
- **VIP customers** access exclusive boats and flexible booking windows

## What you can configure

For each customer type:

- **Booking conditions** - When and how they can book (advance time, duration limits, boat restrictions)
- **Cancellation rules** - Whether they can cancel and under what conditions
- **Custom pricing** - Different rates through pricing conditions
- **Confirmation methods** - Immediate confirm vs payment required

## Getting started

<div class="button-container">
  <a href="https://dashboard.letsbook.app/customer-types" class="button button--primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage customer types</a>
</div>

**Next steps:**

1. [Create and manage customer types](manage-customer-types.md) - Set up new types or modify existing ones
2. [Configure booking and cancellation rules](booking-cancellation-rules.md) - Define specific conditions for each type

Most operators start with just Guest and Member, then add custom types as their business grows.
