# Match the booking form to your brand

Make the booking form feel like your site. Keep it clean, on-brand, and accessible.

To get started, go to [Styling](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/styling).

## What to set

### 1. Logo

- Use a horizontal logo.
- PNG or JPG.
- Min width 320px.

### 2. Fonts

- Pick title and body fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- Featured options are tested to look great in the form.

### 3. Brand color

- Set your primary brand color (HEX or RGB) or use the picker with the eyedropper.
- We auto-pick accessible text contrast for buttons and key UI.

### 4. Interface colors

- Choose a supporting palette for secondary UI elements.
- Keep contrast high for readability.

### 5. Corner style

- Rounded or sharp corners for buttons and panels.
- Change anytime to match your brand.

## Preview in context

- Use the booking form link in the dashboard to preview.
- Then verify on your site after the form is [integrated](add-to-website.mdx).
