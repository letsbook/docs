# Offer alternatives when boats are fully booked

Keep bookings moving even when a boat is taken. Smart alternatives suggest another boat, time, or date - so your customer stays in the flow and your calendar stays full.

## Offer different times and dates

If no boats are available at the requested time, we suggest nearby time slots or another date.

How it works:

- First, we look for alternative times on the same day.
- If none fit, we check the next day, then the next week, and so on.

Because nobody enjoys playing phone tag about availability.

## Suggest another boat from the same category

We treat boats in the same category as valid substitutes. If Model A is booked, we can offer Model B from that same category.

To enable, do this:

1. Assign each [boat](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/models) to a category
2. Enable [alternatives](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/booking-form/alternatives) for the categories that should suggest other models

Example: Put "Speedboats" together. If Speedboat X is booked at 2:00 PM, the system can suggest Speedboat Y at 2:00 PM.

## Turn alternatives off

Prefer to keep choices simple? [Turn off](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/booking-form/alternatives) automatic suggestions per category or globally on the alternatives page.
