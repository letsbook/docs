# Add the booking form to your website

Get your booking form live in two steps: first add our script to load the widget, then link to your booking form URL.

## Step 1: Add the script

Paste this snippet on your site to load the booking widget. You can also find it in the [integration instructions](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/booking-form/integration-instructions).

```html
<!-- Start of Let's Book widget -->
<script
    src="https://cdn.letsbook.app/assets/lb-widgets.min.js"
    type="module"
    defer
></script>
<!-- End of Let's Book widget -->
```

## Step 2: Link to your booking form

Add a button, image, or text link to your booking form URL. Find it in Step 2 of your [booking form settings](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/booking-form/integration-instructions).

### Preselect options

Customize what customers see when they open your booking form:

**Preselect language, boat, or dock:** Start customers at a specific option instead of showing all choices. Great for targeted landing pages.

**Open login panel:** Show the login form immediately. Useful when linking from member-only areas or email campaigns to existing customers.

**Customers must login first:** Force login before booking. Perfect for boat clubs or membership-only operations where only registered members can book.

**Show coupon code popup:** Open the discount code field automatically. Use this when linking from promotional campaigns so customers don't miss their discount.

**Hide language switch:** Remove the language selector if you only serve one market or want to control language through the URL.

These URL parameters automatically generate based on your selections. Copy the generated URL and use it in your website buttons or links.
