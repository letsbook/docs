## Link documents to a dock and boat model

## Configure how it is used

Pick the document and fine-tune:

- **Title**: say it your way or add translations.
- **Description**: we prefill it to save you time; tweak as needed.
- **Who should sign**: Use "Primary renter" or "For every boat" when working with [contracts](../../day-to-day/work-with-contracts.md) and use "All passengers" or "unlimited" when working with [waivers](../../day-to-day/work-with-waivers.md).

:::info
To collect a signature from every passenger, set your [boat model](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/models) to ask for passenger count. Not tracking headcount? Choose "Unlimited" for the document.
