# Implement our API

## How the API works

Read the full reference in our [API docs](/api/index). The API lets one key talk to multiple boat rental companies, so your integrations do not need a key per brand.

## Webhooks (Coming soon)

Webhooks are in the works, so your app can nap until something changes instead of polling like a caffeine enthusiast.

## Obtaining an API key

Create API keys from the [integrations](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/integrations) page. Copy it once and stash it somewhere safe. We only show it at creation.

If your user has access to multiple companies, you see a company selector. You can grant one key access to several companies. Franchises love this because one integration can cover all their Let's Book companies without juggling keys.

:::warning
API keys are not tied to a specific dock and automatically have administrator rights.
