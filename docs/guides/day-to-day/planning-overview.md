# Working with the planning overview

Use the planning overview to run daily operations. Switch between three views to manage bookings, monitor your availability and manage your fleet.

## Accessing planning overview

Go to your [planning overview](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/planning) to see all your operational views in one place. Use the date picker to jump to specific dates, navigate with arrow buttons for day-by-day browsing, or use quick shortcuts for "Today" and "Tomorrow".

## The three views

Switch between the three planning views using the tabs.
