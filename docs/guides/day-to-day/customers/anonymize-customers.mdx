# Anonymize customers

## Why it exists

GDPR (Europe) gives customers the right to be forgotten. Anonymizing a customer removes their personal details, not their history. Their bookings stay put, but you won't find them by name anymore. Use the booking reference or filters instead.

## How to do it

[Find the customer](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/customers) and click Anonymize. One click, privacy mode.

<LocalFileVideoPlayer
    videoSrc={require('../graphics/anonymize_customer.mp4').default}
/>

Changed your mind? Edit the customer and re‑enter their details. Heads‑up: they won't be anonymous anymore.

## Anonymizing customers with an account

Customers with an account can be anonymized too. We'll log them out on the spot, and they won't be able to log back in.
