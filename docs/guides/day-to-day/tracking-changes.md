# Track changes and activity

Keep everyone on the same page without playing detective. Every booking has a timeline that shows exactly what changed, who changed it, and when it happened. No guesswork. No drama. Just facts.

The timeline shows:
- Who made the change (teammate, customer, or system)
- When it happened (date and time)
- What changed (with the before and after where it matters)

## Check activity on the booking
