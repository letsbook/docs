See who changed a booking timeline image and when. This helps you spot whether a teammate or a customer updated it.

## Check activity on the booking

https://dashboard.letsbook.app/bookings

1. Open the booking.
2. Click Timeline.
3. Hover any event to see who performed the action.
4. Look for image related events like "Timeline image uploaded" or "Attachment replaced".

The actor label shows one of the following:

- Team member name
- Customer name
- System

## View file history for bookingtimeline.png

https://dashboard.letsbook.app/bookings/files

1. Open the Files tab on the booking.
2. Search for bookingtimeline.png.
3. Click the file.
4. Open the History panel.

You see a list of versions with:

- Who made the change
- Customer or team role
- Timestamp
- Action, for example uploaded, replaced, or deleted

Click any version to preview it.

## Filter activity feed by images

https://dashboard.letsbook.app/activity

1. Open Activity.
2. Set filters: Booking equals your booking code and Type equals Files.
3. Apply the filter.

Export the result as CSV if you need a record.

## What if a customer changed it

Customer actions are marked with a Customer badge next to the name. You also see the source, for example customer portal or email reply.

If the change is not expected, click Revert in the file history to roll back to the previous version. The system records the revert as your action.
