# Add a booking manually

## Step 1: Start adding a booking

- From **Bookings** â†’ **[Add Booking](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/bookings/add)** (main method)
- Use the **Quick Add** button in the menu bar, the green button on the dashboard overview or click the icon in the planning overviews

## Step 2: Add the customer

- Existing customer? Type their name and select
- New customer? Click **Add New customer**

<LocalFileVideoPlayer
    videoSrc={require('../graphics/add_customer.mp4').default}
    title="Add a customer"
/>

## Step 3: Fill booking details

Fill in date, boat, duration, and extras.

:::note[Override mode options]
By default, you follow the same rules as customers (availability, duration limits, pricing). Need to break the rules? Turn on **Override mode**.

- **Ignore settings** - Book with different pick-up times or durations than allowed
- **Ignore availability** - Place bookings even when no boats are available
- **Ignore cost changes** - Skip automatic price calculations
  :::

/>

## Step 4: Check and adjust

Your booking is now created but needs confirmation. You can still make manual adjustments (like changing the price) before finalizing.

## Step 5: Confirm the booking

Hit **Confirm Booking** to complete the process.

:::note[confirmation options]
You'll find these confirmation options:

- **Send confirmation email to customer** - Toggle on/off
- **Add payment link in email** - Include payment request in the confirmation
- **Payment deadline** - Click the suggested date to set how long customers have to pay
  :::

**What happens next:** Your booking appears instantly in the overview. You can immediately edit details, add notes, or send payment requests.
