## Using filters for exports

You can use the same filters for exports as you can for the regular bookings overview.

The main filters you can use for exports include:

**Date range:** Select specific start and end dates - all bookings with departures within this range will be included

**Docks:** Filter by specific dock locations to export only bookings from selected docks

**Status:** Export only bookings with specific statuses (Draft, Confirmed, Completed, etc.)

**Add-ons:** Toggle "only with add-ons" to export only bookings that have add-ons attached

**And all other filters:** Boat model, Payment status, Partner, Document, Labels - use any combination to get exactly the data you need

## Tips for exports

- Apply your filters first, then click the export button
- The export will only include bookings that match your current filter settings
- Check your filter selection carefully before exporting to ensure you get the right data
- **Export limit:** There's a maximum of approximately 1,000 results per export. If you have more bookings, split your results by using smaller date ranges or additional filters
