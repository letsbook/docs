# Booking finances

[Open booking](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/bookings) → **Finance tab**

The Finance tab shows your booking's financial overview in three sections: costs (left), received payments (right), and the balance at the top.

## Understanding the balance

The top bar shows the overall payment status:

- **$0.00 Paid in full** (green) = Customer paid everything
- **$X.XX Outstanding** (yellow) = Amount still owed
- **$X.XX Overpaid** (yellow) = Customer paid too much

The balance automatically updates when you add costs, discounts, or payments.

If you've enabled **Keep card on file** in [integrations](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/integrations), you'll see a **Charge card** button here to directly charge saved payment methods.
