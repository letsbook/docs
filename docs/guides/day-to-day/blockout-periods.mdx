# Manage blockout periods

Need to block your schedule for a few hours, days, or even months? With blockout periods, you can instantly pause availability for private events, seasonal closures, or simply when you want to stop taking bookings.

## What are blockout periods?

Blockout periods temporarily remove availability from your booking system. You can block specific boats, entire docks, or your whole fleet for any time period (from minutes to months).

**Common uses:**

- Private events or company outings
- Seasonal closures
- Weather-related shutdowns
- Staff training periods
- Special occasions when you want to pause bookings

## Creating blockout periods

### Method 1: From blockout periods page

1. Go to [blockout periods overview](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/blocks) and click [Add new blockout](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/blocks/new)
2. Fill in the details:
    - **Reason:** Brief description (e.g., "Company outing", "Holiday closure")
    - **Period:** Select dates and times (can customize start/end times beyond midnight)
    - **Dock:** Choose specific docks or "All docks"
    - **Boat model:** Select specific boat types or "All boat models"
3. Click **Save**
