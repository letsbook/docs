# Sell add-ons and extras

ðŸ‘‰ **[Create add-ons](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/add-ons/add)** | **[Setup guide](/guides/settings/create-add-ons)**

Turn every booking into extra revenue. Drinks, safety gear, insurance, food - all automatically offered during checkout.

## Why add-ons work

Customers already decided to rent. The marginal yes to extras is easier than the initial booking decision. Add-ons boost average transaction value with zero extra marketing.

## What sells well

**Safety and equipment:** Life jackets (extra sizes, kids), waterproof phone cases, coolers, fishing gear, wakeboard/ski equipment, navigation devices

**Food and drinks:** Drinks packages (beer, wine, soft drinks), snack boxes, picnic baskets, BBQ packages, ice and cups

**Insurance and protection:** Damage waiver (reduce liability), cancellation insurance, weather guarantee

**Services:** Fuel packages (prepaid), captain service, cleaning service, delivery to alternative pickup/dropoff location

**Special occasions:** Birthday decorations, celebration packages, photography service

## Setting up add-ons

Full setup guide in [create add-ons](/guides/settings/create-add-ons).

**Layout style:** Grid (large photos) for visual items like drinks and gear. Bars (medium photos) for mixed content. Table (compact) for simple lists.

**Pricing:** Choose per booking, per boat, per passenger, or per passenger per hour.

**Quantity limits:** Set maximum items per booking, per boat, per passenger, or per passenger per hour.

**Availability conditions:** Between times, between dates, only at dock using boat model, days of the week, trip duration, minimum time upfront.

**Questions:** Collect preferences like beer/wine ratio, vegetarian options, or t-shirt sizes.

## Smart strategies

**Time-based availability:** Breakfast packages only 8-10am using "between times". Happy hour drinks 4-7pm. Automatically hide items outside their time window.

**Seasonal rotation:** Summer items (cooling, sun protection, water toys) appear June-August with "between dates". Switch to winter gear (heating, rain protection) for off-season. Update once per year.

**Boat-specific offerings:** Show premium add-ons only on luxury boats using "only at dock using boat model". Basic safety gear for all boats, advanced equipment restricted to specific models. Match add-ons to boat capabilities.

**Dock-specific services:** Marina-only captain service, harbor-only fuel packages. Different docks have different capabilities, show relevant add-ons per location.

**Trip-length requirements:** Full-day picnic basket only for 4+ hour rentals using "trip duration". Prevents short-trip customers ordering items they won't use.

**Prep-time items:** Catering packages require 48 hours notice using "minimum time upfront". Photography service needs 7 days. Gives you time to prepare or book external services.

**Weekend specials:** Celebration packages only Friday-Sunday using "days of the week". Weekday equipment discounts Monday-Thursday. Match offerings to customer behavior patterns.

**Per-passenger-per-hour pricing:** Perfect for consumables like drinks. "2 beers per person per hour" automatically calculates correct quantity for group size and trip length. Prevents over/under ordering.

## Boosting sales

**Make them visible:** Upload attractive square photos. Grid layout with clear images beats text-only lists.

**Strategic pricing:** "â‚¬5 per person" sounds better than "â‚¬40 per group" even when identical.

**Stock management:** Mark items "out of stock" when unavailable instead of removing them entirely.

## Handling orders

Daily workflow covered in [handle add-on orders](/guides/day-to-day/add-on-orders).

Orders appear on planning overview. Filter by date, dock, boat model, category, or product. Print order lists for staff. Export summaries for supplier reconciliation.

## Revenue impact

Add-ons typically increase booking value by 20-40%. Focus on 3-5 popular items first. Add more once you nail the basics.
