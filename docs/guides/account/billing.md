# Billing and invoices

[Go to Account Settings](https://dashboard.letsbook.app/account/plan)

## How billing works

When you go live, you agree with our terms and conditions and choose on which plan you'll start with. We set everything up, and from then on you receive monthly invoices via email.

**You get two invoices each month:**

- Invoice for your monthly subscription fee
- Invoice with an overview of booking fees paid that month

**Payment is year-round:** You pay monthly throughout the year. We know boat rentals are seasonal, but our team works year-round improving the platform.

## Payment methods

- Credit card
- iDEAL

## Payment failed?

If a payment doesn't go through:

1. Check your card details are correct
2. Make sure your card has sufficient funds

We'll retry charging automatically. Your account stays active during retry attempts.

## Billing cycle

**Standard Plan:** $30/month (€25/month) + 2.5% booking fee  
**Pro Plan:** $175/month (€150/month) + 1% booking fee

*Please note you can only change plan once every 12 months.

- Charged monthly starting on the day that you went live
- Booking fees overview sent separately
- Additional SMS costs added when applicable
- Year-round payment, including off-season months
