# Manage Boats


## Add boat model

Always add a boat model first, and then link your actual boats to it. That way you can rent out several of the same boats under the same name.

Go the the boat section and hit add. Now enter:

1. **Boat model name**: Enter the boat model name, which will be used to identify all boats within this model. Keep the name simple and consider including the number of people the boat can hold (e.g. "Tender 6p").

2. **Description**: Add a description that will be visible to customers on the booking form and on overview pages. Make the description informative and compelling.

3. **Photos**: Add horizontal photos in jpg or png format. You may want to crop the photos in advance using a photo editing tool or online service.

4. **Specs**: Add specifications that you think are important for customers to see at a glance.

### Working with categories

Using categories can help you organize your boat types and make it easier for customers to find the right boat. Customers can filter boat types by category, and you can rearrange the order of categories on the booking form by clicking " rearrange." You can also add a description for each category that will be shown on the booking form.

## Edit specific boats

After adding a boat model, you will see a list of one or more boats that belong to the model (depending on how many boats you selected). To make these boats available for rent, you need to set:

1. **Boat name**: This is the name of a specific boat within the boat model. When customers start a booking themselves, they will need to indicate which boat they are using. This name will be used to identify the boat.

2. **Boat placement**: Select the dock and set the availability for rentals at that location.

## Move a boat

You can use the "add to timeline" button to schedule when a boat will be docked at another location. Note that the boat is still available for rent at the original location until it is moved.

## Take a boat out of service

To remove a boat from rental, select "out of service." This is useful if the boat is undergoing maintenance or otherwise unavailable for rent.
