Walkthrough: Setting up new slot pricing. Make sure you have created a slot schedule first.

#### 1. Basic information

* Give this slot pricing setup a name – we used 'Default - summer' – and choose whether VAT should be charged.
* Select the slot schedule that the prices will apply to. In our case that's 'Default summer slots'.

### 

* Set the prices for each slot. The yellow dots indicate where something is still missing.

Do you want to add something on top of the standard prices? Then choose '**add pricing element**'.In this example, customers will pay $5 extra for every passenger:

In this example we offer a discount for the second boat in a booking.

#### 3. Additional charges (optional)

Calculate costs on top of the standard price (e.g. €20 cleaning fee).

You can also add conditions (e.g. only pay cleaning costs if sailing for more than 2 hours). You can add multiple conditions.If the calculation is even more complex, you can also add more pricing elements.

#### 4. Deposits (optional)

Add a deposit that can be refunded later. This example shows a deposit of €150:
