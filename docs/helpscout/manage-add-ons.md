----------

Add-ons are extras that customers can add to their trip to enhance their experience. To create an add-on, go to the add-ons section and click "new add-on".

**Name, short & long descriptions and categories**

The short description for an add-on will be shown on overview pages in the booking form, and the long description will be displayed on the add-on detail page. You can also add the add-on to one or more categories (e.g. "chilled drinks" or "small snacks") to group them in the add-on overview.

**Images**

Add square photos in jpg or png format. You may want to crop the photos in advance using a photo editing tool or online service. The first photo will be displayed on the overview page.

:   **Pricing & limitations** 

    Set a price per quantity, with an optional limits on the number of items that can be ordered per booking, boat, passenger, or passenger per hour. For example, allow customers to order 2 beers per person per hour.

     **Between times**: Only available between certain times.  
     **Only at dock using boat model**: Only available at a specific combination of a boat model and dock.  
     **Days of the week**: Only available on certain days of the week.  
     **Minimum rental duration**: Only available for trips of a certain duration.
