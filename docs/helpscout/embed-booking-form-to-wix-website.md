Embed the booking form on a Wix website
=======================================

Here's how you can make the form appear on your Wix website:

1. Click on booking form settings and copy the 'booking form' code to your clipboard
2. Go to Settings in your Wix site's dashboard.
3. Scroll to the Advanced section, and click the Custom Code tab.
4. Click + Add Custom Code at the top right.
5. Paste the code snippet in the text box and enter a name for your code (for example: Let's Book booking form)
6. Under 'Add Code to Pages': choose 'All pages' en let the code load on each page your visitor opens.
7. At 'Place Code in': choose 'Head' and click Apply.

From now on you can link texts and buttons to the url's you can generate at booking form settings. This will automatically open the booking form on your Wix website.
