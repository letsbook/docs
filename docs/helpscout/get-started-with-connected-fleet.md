# Remote boat control: Implementation guide

**In short**

It possible to make a hardware connection between your boat and the Let's Book platform. You can easily connect bookings to specific boats and start the engine directly from the software.

In this article we explain how to set up. Here are the steps you should go through before you get started:

### **1. Connect your boats**

Connect your boats to Let's Book. At the moment this can be done via Trackunit, Qondor or via an SMS-Relay. Read here how to set it up.

### **2. Manage notifications**

Via Notifications, you can manage what information your customers receive about their booking and trip. For example, you can include additional instructions in the booking confirmation to explain how they can start the boat themselves.

- **Text messages**

    You can add extra text messages to a notification flow by clicking ‘Add.’ Schedule messages to send, for example, one day or 15 minutes before the trip starts. These include a link to the booking detail page with the start interface.

    Due to country-specific regulations, the text cannot be edited, and supported countries are limited. Currently, messages are sent in Dutch, English, Danish, Spanish, Swedish, Italian, or Portuguese. For other languages, the message will be in English.

### **3. Manage texts in the interface**

Fine-tune your interface texts via Text & languages. You’ll find the relevant copy in the 'Browse' section under 'Booking details'. This allows you to add specific directions or tips that are helpful for your customers.

Once live, the booking detail page shows when a customer has picked, started, paused, or stopped a boat, or switched to another boat. You can also manually link boats to bookings from this page or via your fleet overview.
