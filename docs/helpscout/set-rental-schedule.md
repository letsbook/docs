# Schedules

We have two types of schedules:

## Slot schedule

Timeslots are designed for structured rentals where you want to fix both the start times and durations of trips. This setup is ideal for scenarios like multi-day trips or predefined packages, ensuring consistency in your scheduling. Customers will choose from the options you define, such as a '2-day weekend rental' or '4-hour afternoon trip.' Perfect for businesses offering specific timeframes or longer-term rentals."

**Pros:**

- Full control over specific start times and trip durations.
- Ideal for structured offerings like multi-day rentals or fixed packages.
- Prevents overlapping bookings, ensuring smoother operations.

**Cons:**

- Fixed time slots might not align with all customer preferences.
- Less flexible compared to Weekly Schedules, especially for shorter or spontaneous bookings.

## Weekly Schedule

Weekly Schedules allow you to set flexible availability within your chosen opening hours. Customers can select a trip duration from the options you define, like '1 hour' or '3 hours.' However, this setup doesn't support multi-day rentals. It's best suited for businesses offering hourly or short-term rentals, giving customers the freedom to tailor their trip length within the day.

**Pros:**

- Maximum flexibility for customers to tailor their trip length.
- Simplifies scheduling with automatic availability adjustments based on bookings.
- Works seamlessly for businesses with high turnover or short-term rentals.

**Cons:**

- Multi-day rentals are not supported, limiting options for longer trips.
- Allows overlapping start and end times, which might require more oversight.
