Quick to: Enter billing details  â€¢  What's on the invoice

Enter billing details
---------------------

Before you go live, we need information on how we can send you invoices. Go to Billing and:

1
:   #### **Enter invoice address**

    This will be used on the invoice

2
:   #### Enter a billing contact

    This is the person and email address the invoice will be sent to

3
:   #### Tax ID

    You can enter your Tax ID here. If you are registered in the EU (outside of the Netherlands), no tax will be charged on bills (VAT reverse-charged).

What's on the invoice
---------------------

Billing occurs once a month. The following will be billed:

- Monthly membership fee (if on Pro or Enterprise plan)   
 - Metered usage (text messages sent through the platform)   
   
 **Platform costs**   

Additionally, there may be platform costs charged for each transaction. If you are on the Starter or Pro plan, a small percentage will be taken off each transaction. This can be found by checking the transaction details with your payment service provider (Stripe/Mollie). Enterprise plans do not have transaction fees.
