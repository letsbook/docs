Team roles
==========

Introduction
------------

Different team members may need access to different information within Let's Book. To control the information that a group of team members can access, you can create team roles with specific rights and limitations. This can be helpful for small businesses to limit, for example, the access that dock assistants can have, or for larger businesses to support a franchise structure.

Default roles
-------------

We have defined several default team roles:

a
:   **Administrator** This person has all permissions and cannot have their permissions changed.

b
:   **Operations manager** This person is responsible for managing global planning, incoming bookings, rental settings, and payments.

c
:   **Planner** This person is responsible for managing the current booking schedule.

d
:   **Dock host** This person welcomes customers, gives instructions, and waves them off.
