Use different prices in a season
--------------------------------

You can create multiple price structures and connect them to a boat/dock combination in the Rental setup. In the rental setup, you can specify when each price structure should be applied (e.g. for a specific season).

  

**Passing Booking Fees to Customers**
-------------------------------------

With this feature, you have the flexibility to pass booking fees directly to your customers instead of absorbing them yourself. This helps protect your margins while keeping pricing transparent.

**How to enable it:**

1. Go to Pricing settings.
2. Find the option **"Pass the booking fee to customer"**.
3. Toggle it on and choose between:
   * **Standard fee** - default percentage
   * **Custom fee** - This gives you the option to work with a formula or a fixed amount.

Once enabled, the fee will be added to the total price at checkout, ensuring clear cost breakdowns for your customers.
