# Schedules - Setup weekly schedule

## Walkthrough

To set up a weekly schedule, go to the schedules overview page and click new weekly schedule.

### 1. Set schedule

You will start with a default day schedule, which you can adjust to your preferences. In this example, the schedule is for a Monday. Boats can be picked up and returned anytime between 10am and 6pm, but cannot be sailed before 10am or after 6pm.

See an extra explanation of the interface with an example of how it would work if the operator had a lunch break.

### 2. Trip duration

There are two options for setting trip duration:

- **Fixed lengths**: Offer a limited number of duration options.
- **Within Range**: Determine conditions and let the platform generate a list of durations.

#### Fixed lengths example

Customers can rent a boat for 2, 3, 4, or 6 hours, with pick-ups every 30 minutes. The 3 and 4-hour durations will be highlighted on the booking form.

#### Within range example

Customers can rent a boat for 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 hours, with pick-ups every 30 minutes.

### 3. Early Pickup (optional)

Use this feature to allow customers to leave earlier than the pick-up time of their booking.

### 4. Margins around booking (optional)

Use this feature to add time between trips for boat cleaning or if boats are often returned late. For example, you can add a 30-minute margin after every trip to clean the boat.

In this example you'll have 30 minutes after every trip for cleaning.
