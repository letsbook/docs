# Pricing - Setup simple pricing

## Walkthrough

This page takes you through the simple pricing setup flow.

#### 1. Basic information

Give this price setting a name and adjust the line that customers see on the booking form (optional). You can also add variables using the "+" button. Choose whether VAT should be charged and the amount.

#### 2. Enter pricing

Enter prices based on the length of the trip. If your schedule allows for booking 3.5 hours, it will charge the next known price (e.g. €140 in the example).

You can also base the price on the number of passengers. For example, if you want to charge a different price for a group of up to 5 people than for a group of 6 to 10 people, you can enter it this way:

#### 3. Additional charges (optional)

Use this option to calculate costs on top of the standard price. For example, a €20 cleaning fee.

You can also add **conditions** (e.g. only pay cleaning costs if sailing for more than 2 hours). You can add multiple conditions. If the calculation is even more complex, you can also add more pricing elements.

#### 4. Deposits (optional)

Add a deposit that can be refunded later. In this example, a deposit of €150:
