# Sync planning with my own calendar

Want to see your bookings automatically appear in your personal calendar? With our calendar sync feature, you can connect Let’s Book to your Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook—so you’re always up to date.

## How it works

Once activated, Let’s Book will generate a unique link for your account. This link allows your external calendar to stay in sync with your booking schedule.

**What’s synced?**

Bookings from the past 7 days and the next 30 days.

**Update frequency:**

- **Google Calendar:** Updates every 12 hours
- **Apple Calendar:** You control the refresh rate (min. 5 mins)
- **Outlook:** Depends on your local settings

2. Click **My calendars** in the **Stay in Sync** section.
3. Activate one (or more) feeds.
4. Copy the link and paste it into your calendar app:
