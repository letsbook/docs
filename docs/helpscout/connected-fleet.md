# Connect Trackunit / Qondor / SMS hardware

We made it possible to make a hardware connection between your boat and the Let's Book platform. You can easily connect bookings to specific boats and start the engine directly from the software.

## Connect via Trackunit

To connect your boat via Trackunit, make sure you are using Trackunit's services and that the hardware is installed in your boat. Then follow these steps:

1
: Find the serial number in the Trackunit dashboard under the Telematics section for your boat. Copy it to your clipboard.

2
: Go to your boat model(s) and select the correct boat model. Now click on the specific boat you want to connect.

3
: Scroll down to the 'Connect Boat' section and choose 'Trackunit' as the connection method.

4
: Paste the serial number and save the boat. From now on, you can control this boat through Let's Book.

## Connect to Qondor

First make sure the hardware is installed in your boat. Then follow these steps:

1
: You can find the tracker ID in your Qondor dashboard or on the tracker itself. Copy it to your clipboard.

2
: Go to your boat model(s) and select the correct boat model. Now click on the specific boat you want to connect.

3
: Scroll down to the 'Connect Boat' section and choose 'Qondor' as the connection method.

## Connect via SMS-Relay

2
: Scroll down to the 'Connect Boat' section and choose 'SMS relay' as the connection method.

3
: Enter the necessary information. Remember to set an instruction timeout, which ensures there is a period of time between the 'on' and 'off' signals to prevent them from being received in the wrong order.
