2. Set a title for your new flow, and hit 'Save'. Now you'll find it back in the 'All flows' section.

## Text messages (sms)

Click on a notification flow and select ‘Add.’ You’ll find options to schedule text messages, such as one day or 15 minutes before the trip starts. These messages include a link to the booking detail page with the start interface.

Please note that regulations for sending automated text messages vary by country. As a result, the text cannot be edited, and the number of supported countries is limited. Currently, we send messages in Dutch, English, Danish, Spanish, Swedish, Italian, or Portuguese, depending on your customer's language. If their language is not supported, the message will be sent in English.

### **Why use multiple flows?**

You can create different flows to tailor the information for specific boat types or locations. This allows you to include details such as directions to the jetty or special instructions for a particular boat.

For example, renting a canoe for 2 hours requires far less communication than renting a yacht for several weeks. With multiple flows, you have full control over what information is shared and when.
