About Rental Methods
====================

Quick to: Introduction •  Setup individual parts •  Combine in Rental Setup

Introduction
------------

The Rental Method is the foundation of the Let's Book system. In a nutshell, it allows you to link your schedule, pricing, and notifications to a combination of a dock and a boat type. Here's how it works:

1. Set the individual parts
---------------------------

First create your individual settings for:

* Schedule - when the boat is available for rent.
* Pricing - the rental price.
* Confirmation - when bookings are confirmed.
* Notifications - the messages that customers receive.

You can create different versions of the above to allow flexibility, such as using different prices or schedules for different boats.

  

2. Combine them in the Rental Setup
-----------------------------------

1. **Find dock / boat combination**

   To set up your rental method, go to the Rental Setup section and click on the dock/boat model combination you want to configure.
2. **Set timings and select settings**

   Choose the period in which the rules will apply and select the schedule, pricing, confirmation method, and notification flow.
3. **Save**

   Save changes and test booking form to ensure proper functionality.

Transition period
-----------------

When you start a new schedule, you might want bookings to continue from the previous one; otherwise, all boats have to be back at the dock when the new schedule starts.

Go to your rental methods and and click a dock / boat type combination. In the 'transition period' section, check 'Allow trips from the previous period to continue into this one' and set the overflow time.

  

**Example**

In this example, multi-day slots with a pickup between June 1 and June 30 are granted the flexibility to return until August 7, thanks to your 7-day transition period starting from August 1.
