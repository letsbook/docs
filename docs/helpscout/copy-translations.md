# Text & Translations

Quick to: Change copy • Language packs • Variables • Manually add translation

## Change copy

You can customize all text that your customers see to match your own style and preferences. Go to text & languages. Use **search** or **browse** to find the desired word or phrase. At the 'edit' section, you will find the reference and editable text fields.

## Language packs

**Activate a language pack**

Go text & languages and find the 'My languages' section for a list of the languages currently in use. Click the add language button. We provide 6 language packs that have been thoroughly reviewed and verified. Additionally, we offer 5 AI-translated language packs. While these have been translated using advanced AI tools, there may be minor errors. If you come across any incorrect translations, we’d greatly appreciate it if you let us know!

**Custom translations**

Some text is not included in these language packs and AI translations. You can edit these texts directly in the screens where you manage them. Look for the globe icon under the input field to access all activated languages and edit their translations.

Example

**Set a language as default**

Go to text & languages, select a language, and use the toggle labeled "Set as Default Language."

**Delete language**

Go to text & languages, select a language, and click the three dots in the top-right corner of the card. From there, choose "Remove."

## Variables

Through the system, you can easily insert variables into your text. This ensures that the correct details are automatically added to the content.

- Simply click the green button (+) and select the desired variable.
- In the notifications section, where you manage your emails, you can take it a step further: add buttons, images, and content blocks for a more polished and engaging message.

## Add manual translated language

Choose a starting point for your translations when adding an unsupported language:

- Go to "Add Translation" and find the select box labeled "Other Language." Choose your desired language.
- Select a "Fallback Language" to use as a starting point. This allows you to build on the text you've already created in another language, which is especially helpful if you've made many edits to the existing copy.
- If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new translation from scratch. While doing so, you'll have access to the reference text to guide you as you translate.

\*Note that variables (words within `\{}`) should not be translated. However, if a variable contains another variable (e.g., `\{xxx \{yyy}}`), only translate the inner content `\{yyy}`.
