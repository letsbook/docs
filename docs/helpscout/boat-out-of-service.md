Take a boat out of service
==========================

Remove a boat (temporarily) from rental
---------------------------------------

1
:   **Find the specific boat**  
     Go to the boat model overview, click the model and find the specific boat in the list.

2
:   **Take a boat out of service** Click the boat and choose "temporarily out of service" to immediately remove it from rental. You can do this, for example, if the boat is undergoing maintenance or repair.

3
:   **Set when it's back in service** If known, set the date when the boat will be available for rental again.

4
:   **Check your planning** Check the planning to see if the boat's removal causes any issues and adjust bookings as needed.

Example
-------

In this example, we remove a boat from rental immediately and set it to be available a few days later.
