Customer Types
==============

About
-----

A customer type is a group of customers with specific rights and limitations. You can create different customer types with different settings around prices, cancellation conditions, and the selection of boats they can choose from.

Default roles
-------------

There are two default customer roles that you can adjust but not remove:

* **Guest** - this is the default role for someone who makes a booking without creating an account.
* **Member** - this is the default role for someone who has created an account. You can customize this role as you wish.

Create new Customer Type
------------------------

1. Go to the Customer Types section.
2. Scroll to the 'other roles' and click 'Add'.
3. Enter the name, abbreviation, and description for this customer group. Customers will not see this information.
4. Set the permissions and restrictions, and save it.

To give customers this role, edit their profile and select the newly created 'Customer Type'.

  

Adding restrictions to a customer type
--------------------------------------

To manage restrictions for customer types you can set one or more conditions:

1. Go to your customer types
2. Click the customer type you want to edit
3. Click on 'add condition'
4. Pick a condition and click save

Conditions:

* **Allowed dock and boat model combination -** Customer can only book at a specific dock with a specific boat
* **Allowed days of the week -** Customer can only make a booking for specific days of the week.
* **Excluded dates -** Customer cannot make a booking on specific dates.
* **Minimum time booked ahead -** Bookings can only be made with a minimum amount of time ahead. For example, we may require that customer books at least 2 hours in advance to ensure that boats are properly prepared and available for the reservation.
* **Maximum time booked ahead -** Customer can only book within a certain timeframe in advance.
* **Maximum booking duration -** There is a maximum duration for each trip that can be booked.
* **Maximum number of bookings on the same day -** There is a maximum number of bookings that can be made for the same day.
* **Maximum number of boats per booking -** There is a limit on the number of boats that can be reserved in a single booking.
* **Maximum number of future bookings -** There is a maximum number of future bookings that can be made.
* **Maximum combined duration of bookings in the future -** Set a maximum combined duration of future bookings

**Pricing settings**

In the pricing settings, you can apply discounts or additional fees for specific customer types.

  

Cancellation settings
---------------------

By default, customers cannot cancel their booking. You can enable it and optionally add the minimum time until the customer can pickup the boat. Go to customer types, select the role you want to edit and find the section called 'cancellation settings'. You can also add a specific message before cancelling, where for example, you can still communicate the conditions for cancellation.

  

We won't automatically refund when a booking is canceled, so you can do the further financial handling manually.

  

Deleting a role
---------------

1. Select the customer type and view the Detail page.
2. Click the three dots after 'Name & description' and choose 'Revoke'.
